Problem statement (ICBM)

Marina smiles.


"We all helped Yurunova and Czerny in the recent invasion of the demon beast. We apologize for not thanking you, but please forgive me."


Ekaterina and Flora involuntarily looked at each other.


"Actually, I've always wanted to talk to them, but I wasn't happy with the pattern ... because."


Marina turns red.


"When Yurunova first came to class ... The appearance of her brother taking her hand and being with her was so beautiful! Both of them were so mature that I couldn't think they were the same students. It's like someone from another world. I thought I shouldn't talk to him! "


Oh…….

sorry. It seems that the villain brothers and sisters were uselessly powerful.

Oh, what would the background be if Onii-sama was also a set ... Disney movie Ice Castle? Hmm, Onii-sama, who has fallen to the dark side, is set as the lonely owner of the ice castle, and it's super moe!

That's not the case right now, stupid or myself!

However, I'm fascinated by Miss Marina, but I wonder if this child is a fan of Onii-sama.


"But I've come to think that Yurunova is actually a friendly person. He talked to Czerny, and then I mentioned earlier."


Marina hurriedly cuts her words to endure laughter.

What was it earlier ... [Excretion]?

When I said [excretion], the Countess was caught.

It's strange. As I said, I think you're an elementary school boy because you feel familiar with it.


"I'm sorry Czerny, too. I heard that he was born to the common people, but it's much more elegant and beautiful than I am. Maybe it's really different, or something behind it. Or, I've misunderstood. "


Flora smirked with a screaming tone.

Ekaterina smiles as she looks at Flora again.


"Krymov, I know what you're looking for. I can't apologize, but if you like it, accept the apology.

Thank you for your frank words. If you don't mind, I'll talk to you intimately from now on. "

"I'm glad! Please call me Marina."

"Then I'm with Ekaterina."

"Can Czerny call me Flora-sama?"

"of course"


At that time, the three girls smiled and the air became warm.


"that……"


There was a quiet voice.


"Oh, I want to apologize, too. At that time ... I'm sorry."


Desperately standing behind Marina is a petite girl with young grass-colored eyes, with shiny maroon hair tied up with a ribbon. Probably the Baron's daughter, who is not very noticeable in the class.

But what are you sorry for?

Ekaterina remembered, leaning her head.


"Hello, at the training site"


A child who fell while escaping from the demon beast?


"Yes, that's right. My name is Olga Fleurs.

I fell down at that time. If you think it's no good, there is a clay wall. Thank you for your help.

Yurunova stayed there because of that ... I've always been wondering if I couldn't escape ... "


No, that's not the case. I don't mind!

However, [I knew that a demon beast would appear and I was willing to fight, so it's okay! ] I can't say.

So let's say this for the time being.


"Did you have any injuries?"


The girl with maroon hair was eye-opening and nodded.


"Yes. Thank you for your safety."


Yup. Really.

I'm glad everyone was safe.


"I was just reckless. That's it. I was able to escape and I should have escaped. And yet I chose not to do it myself. I was later scolded by my brother. Noyo "


With a smile, Olga smiled with tears in her eyes.


"That, we too!"


A group of students screamed from behind Olga, and Ekaterina was scared.

The students, including boys, are approaching with a enthusiastic look, centered around Marina, who is the biggest force in this class (or rather a fan girl?).


"I also want to apologize"

"I wanted to talk."

"I'm sorry to run away, it's amazing to face that."


Well, this is ... what?


The teachers came there and they all hurried back to their seats.

Ekaterina couldn't help thinking.


I thought that if I professed Onii-sama's oath and Flora's holy attributes, the overt meanness would disappear. The previous one was beyond expectations.

What is the prestige of the Duke of Yurunova?

In the game, the heroine should have been mean for a while after the event. Is this also moving away from the game?

Will Flora's meanness disappear as it is? Or will the laws of the game work soon and it will return to its original state?

Of course, I'd be happy if the meanness disappeared, but it's possible that some distortion will occur and unexpected problems will occur due to the deviation from the game.

Don't let your guard down anyway.


However, during the lunch break of the day, Ekaterina completely forgets that attitude.




There was a new face in the office where I brought food as usual.

Ephrem Rozen. Yurunova is the leader of the Knights.

He is about his mid-40s and has a mustache of the same color as his iron-gray hair.

Ekaterina was excited about the fantasy she wore in her previous life and the knights of the Knights Templar that actually existed around the table, and Alexei said.


"It's almost time for the rose season. That's why I was informed that the date for the imperial family to go to the Duke's residence was decided this year. You need to prepare for your first visit to Their Majesties. Then say "

"... What?"



The imperial family goes to the duke's residence ...?



Yukiyuki.

Let's go in Japanese. Also read Miyuki.

Miyuki once again. Hyakunin Isshu. What is the above phrase ... Autumn leaves of the peak. No, I can't remember the beginning.

Ah, escapism doesn't stop!


Did you say that the imperial family will come to our house ?!



As expected, Onii-sama. The quality of the problem statement is very different from mine.

I understand the words, but I can't understand the meaning.

ICBM (Intercontinental Ballistic Missile) It's as shocking as being hit!
