Problem statement (NG word)

Classes resumed three days after the appearance of the demon beast. Even if I searched thoroughly, I could not find any traces, let alone the appearance of the demon beast, and because there was a curriculum of the lesson, a safety declaration was issued on the condition that the Imperial City Guard patrols.

The sight of armed guards passing by in the school was tense, but the school was rejuvenated when the students returned.


Ekaterina invites Flora to go to school together. Even when they entered the classroom, both of them were taken away by their classmates, but they are used to it.

I think they were aiming alone, but I heard a deafening voice.


"I don't like it, I don't want the cause to come to school with a big face."

"Yes, that's right."


...... I even feel nostalgic for the first time in a few days with this sarcasm.

And I was waiting.


"You seem to hear strange words now."


Ekaterina turns to Soiya trio with a scornful smile that looks great on villainess and raises the edges of her lips.


"What is the cause?"

"Oh, oh"


Soiya trio seems to be agitated in response to Ekaterina, who usually goes all-through in their remarks.


"Well, it's a demon beast the other day. It's strange that such a thing appears at this magic school. Someone must have planned something."

"Yes, that's right."


Ekaterina lifted her eyebrows as she gently grasped Flora's hand, anxiously pulling her sleeves, to reassure her.


"If you think it's strange, the Imperial Capital Guard is investigating with all your might. It's a grounded statement because you say that it's the cause, right? You have some evidence that the guard can't find it either. Then why don't you submit it immediately? "


"Well, proof ... but everyone is saying. I wonder if a commoner of different status planned something."

"Yes, that's right."


Ekaterina put one hand on her mouth. The point is to raise your little finger a little.


"Oh ho ho ho!"


Laugh high. The villainess laugh I wanted to try once!

And while carrying a dark cloud in the background and running lightning, Ekaterina looked down at Soiya trio.


"What is everyone? I would like to know your specific name."

"Well, everyone is everyone."


Yeah, all three of you. I know.


"It's just a malicious delusion. I can't overlook it as a Yurunova family anymore.

I would like to take this opportunity. My brother, Alexei, Duke of Yurunova, has made a vow. Flora Czerny, my lifesaver, is a friend of all those in the name of Yurunova, and Flora-sama's enemies are Yurunova's enemies. "


When I heard that it was a vow, Soiya trio suddenly changed her complexion.


"And I would like to inform you that the magical attribute of Flora-sama has been revealed. Flora-sama has a rare [holy] attribute. In the Astra Empire, it is called a saint and is revered. You know that it was. "


Ekaterina says so that everyone in the class can hear it.

I set up Soiya trio because I wanted to do this.


"Then, I'll not be ...... talk but is absurd remarks of Yara and [something plotting it]. What How you can cause that such an event if a. Pre-somewhere in catching that beast Did you send it to your accomplice? Did you know the secrets of the Astra Empire that no one knew and called you there?

It's amazing! You have a difficult organization or culture! Cheeks! "


Suddenly, Ekaterina dropped the tone of her voice.

The background is a dark lightning strike.


"Even if that could happen ...?"


Soiya trio screams at the voice that crawls on the bottom of the earth.

If you make a loud voice, you can stop it around you, but even if you make a low voice, you can't stop it. If you get angry, lower the tone of your voice. Hi, I'm going to test my life.


"If you think about it for a moment, you'll understand."


Ekaterina smiled, changing her expression. With a bright voice


"A fool who doesn't even know this should be eaten by the demon beast and excreted!"


The villainess laugh that I laughed at for the third time echoed in the tremendous silence that fell into the class.


...... Yeah, I thought about it myself.

There is no [excretion], isn't it?

Even though it's Ojou-sama. [Excretion] is an NG word, isn't it?

But somehow it came out of my mouth.

Let's flush it into the water and run away. Only for [excretion].


"... I think so."


Laugh, yes, this is the end of the story!

I wanted to decide ...


There was a sign that I pulled the chair and stood up.


When I wonder who he is, he is the countess who feels like a high-ranking school caste who is the central figure in the class.

Get up and walk here.

With a laugh, Ekaterina also stood up. I don't know the intention, but I'll meet you.


The Countess, who was the first to meet her face-to-face, looked glittering when she looked at it again. After all, the colors are bright. The brilliance of fiery redheads with golden eyes and straight semi-long redheads with gold mixed like a mesh.

Slightly sunburned skin, a little freckles scattered around the nose. It has a boyish and well-organized face, strong eyes and a wild taste. Above all, he looks like an athlete because his body is so tight that he can see it even from the top of his uniform.


Is this a girl who is more popular with girls than the top school castes?

I was in class when I was in high school, but I think I'm an Aniki girl who plays an active part in sports club competitions and is said to be a girl because she's boyish and cool.


The Countess stood in front of Ekaterina, eye-to-eye, and said in a familiar voice.


"It's my first time to talk to you in the same class. I'm Marina Krymov."

"I'm sorry to bother you. I'm Ekaterina Yurunova."


Compete with a graceful smile. Ekaterina, with her indigo hair, purplish blue eyes, and clear white skin, is like a dark spirit, as opposed to Marina's color, which is as bright as the spirit of Akatsuki. The two girls facing each other were in stark contrast.


Marina's golden eyes were narrowed. Coupled with a slender and toned body, it is a feline creature.


"Yurunova, I ..."


Come on, what are you doing!


"I'm here to apologize."


……What?
