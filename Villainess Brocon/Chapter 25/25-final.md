Event Clear and Oath

A hush fell over the training grounds.

Flora's body swayed unsteadily, and Ekaterina rushed to embrace her from behind. But her legs were not strong enough either, and they both sat down slumped.

Half-crying, wobbling and shaking, Ekaterina hugged Flora.



Thank you, thank you.

I can't believe she'd stand in front of such a scary thing to protect me.

Flora-chan, how brave you are.

You must have been scared, too.

You're amazing.

After all, the heroine is amazing.



"Fu, fu, Flora-sama, are, are you okay?"


Ekaterina fretted as she took care of Flora.



"I'm okay..."


With a sigh, Flora gently laid her hand on Ekaterina's arm that was wrapped around her.


"Are you injured, Ekaterina-sama?"

"I, I'm fine..."


After she replied, Ekaterina realized that Flora had called her by her first name for the first time.


Then,


"Ekaterina!"


Alexei rushed over and touched his sister on the shoulder.


"Onii-sama!"


Turning around, Ekaterina jumped into her brother's arms.



Waaaah, I was scared! ï¸Ž


Alexei hugged his sister as hard as he could, forgetting to take it easy on her as she cried like a child.


"Ekaterina ...... Ekaterina."


Owww. It hurts so much that my body cries, but I'm glad for that now.

It hurts! I'm alive!


It didn't matter that I was a corporate slave in my 30s, it was still scary. I thought I was going to die!

In a previous life, there was a system failure and I was told that if I didn't restore the system within three hours, I would be charged billions in compensation, so my hands were shaking and my heart was palpitating so much I thought I was going to die. I thought I was going to die, but I didn't really die!

Those fangs!

It's scary even just remembering it, I'm scared!



Alexei, who had been repeating his sister's name in a weak voice, came back to himself when he heard Ekaterina moan softly, and finally loosened his arms.


"Sorry, does it hurt?"


Still clinging to her brother, Ekaterina shook her head.


"Thank you, Onii-sama ... Thank you for coming ... Thank you ..."


With a snorting nose, Ekaterina finally said, Alexei whispered with a little effort on her sister's arm.

When Ekaterina finally said it, sniffling, Alexei put a little more strength back into the arms that held his sister and whispered.

"I'll go anywhere for you. I'll go to hell and back to save you. I promise."


.....................................Kyuu.



I'm dead! Death from moe at every element!


While in his arms! In my ear! He whispered to me, with Onii-sama's wonderful voice!

The effect was doubled because of the hoarseness in his voice! And doubled again because of the brocon!

Do these words sound like J-POP lyrics, or are they maybe used in anime theme songs? But I'm not trying to show off or anything, I'm just expressing what I really think as accurately as possible!

Above all, as the saying goes, he really rushed in without regard for the danger to his life!


No more, your sister won't get married to anyone! Onii-sama, take responsibility!


I swear that I'm not just being an idiot.

Even though I was dying, my legs started to feel stronger. Moe is vitality!



"Onii-sama ... Flora-sama helped me."


Ekaterina said, noticing that Flora, still unable to stand, was looking up at them with a smile.


Alexei nodded and released his arms from holding his sister.

Then he got down on one knee in front of Flora and took her hand.


"Flora Czerny-sama."


He graciously called out and bowed down to her as he held her hand.



A beautiful young man kneeling before a beautiful girl!

What a feast for the eyes! It's like a painting!



Internally, Ekaterina was all hyped up.


"I would like to thank you for your courage in saving my sister's life. And again, I want to apologize for my rudeness the other day. I was a fool."

"I see."


Rolling her eyes, Flora shook her head. But Alexei continued to speak.


"The Yurunova family owes you a debt of gratitude that can never be repaid. Therefore, I would like you to accept this oath."



An oath!

I'm pretty sure the prince did this too in the game!



"I, Alexei, Head of Yurunova, declare Flora Czerny to be an ally of Yurunova. All those who bear the name of Yurunova shall rejoice in the good fortune of their friends, and fight their enemies as their enemies.

Your enemy is my enemy, and your joy is my joy.

As such, I, the head Alexei, do hereby swear."



Wow ...

The Sengoku-like wording that seems to be a remnant of the founding era makes the heart of a reki-jo throb!



"Your Excellency ...! Please don't worry. I am the one who owes Lady Ekaterina more than I can ever repay. Don't kneel down to me."

"You can't stand until you accept the oath. Because that's what an oath is."


Alexei says gently to Flora, who shakes her head. On the contrary, that calmness makes me feel an unwavering determination that I cannot move even with leverage.

"I, I understand. I will accept it. So stand up. Please stand up."


Flora said in an embarrassed manner, and Alexei smiled a little. As he stood up, he gently pulled on Flora's hand.

With her eyes wide open, Flora clung to Alexei's hand and slowly got up.



Oh, Onii-sama is nice! A beautiful man and a beautiful girl are really picturesque!


But ... isn't this ...

A flag?

I wonder. I don't know......


I thought there was no route where the heroine could capture Onii-sama. But in the game, Onii-sama didn't show up at this event. Unlike the game, he rushed in like this, so maybe a new route was born?

I was a disappointing woman whose only real love life was a black history, so I can't help it if I deviate from the flow of the game.


If that's the case, I'm happy for Onii-sama, but I'm still lonely ... I'm happy to be reincarnated as Onii-sama's younger sister. I still wish I could have tried to capture Onii-sama in that game of my previous life.
