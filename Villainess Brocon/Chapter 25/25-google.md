Event clear and oath

The silence fell quietly in the training ground.


Flora's body sways, and Ekaterina hurriedly hugs her from behind. However, the legs were not strong enough, and both of them had to sit down.


Ekaterina hugs Flora, half-crying and quivering.



Thank you thank you.

You can't stand in front of such a scary guy.

How brave Flora-chan!

You too would have been scared.

It's amazing.

After all, the heroine is amazing.



"Fuck, Flora-sama, oh, are you okay?"


With a kamikami, Ekaterina cares for Flora.



"It's okay"


Answering like a sigh, Flora gently put her hand on Ekaterina's arm, which was turned by herself.


"Isn't Ekaterina-sama injured?"

"Wow, I'm okay ..."


After returning, Ekaterina realizes that Flora first called her name.


There,


"Ekaterina!"


Alexei rushed to touch his sister's shoulder.


"Onii-sama!"


Looking back, Ekaterina jumped into her brother's arm.



Wow, I was scared! ︎


Alexei hugged her sister, who started crying like a child, as much as she could, forgetting to adjust.


"Ekaterina …… Ekaterina"


painful. It hurts so much that my body squeaks, but I'm happy with that now.

It hurts-I'm alive!


I'm scared of scary things, whether it's arasa or a company slave, I thought I'd die!

I had been told that a system failure occurred in my previous life, and if I didn't restore it within three hours, I would be asked for billions of compensations. That didn't really die!

That fang!

I'm scared even if I remember, I was scared! ︎



Alexei, who repeated his sister's name in a murky voice, returned to himself when he heard Ekaterina moaning, and finally loosened his arm.


"Sorry, was it painful?"


Ekaterina shakes her head, clinging to her brother.


"Thank you, Onii-sama ... Thank you for coming ... Thank you ..."


With a snorting nose, Ekaterina finally said, Alexei whispered with a little effort on her sister's arm.



"I'll go anywhere for you. I'll go to help if I'm in hell. Be sure."



………………………………………………………… Moxibustion.



Dead! Moe died in every element!


Be hugged! At your ear! It was whispered, with a nice voice from Onii-sama!

The effect is doubled because the voice is painfully blurred! Double because of brocon!

Is the word also the lyrics of J-POP or is it the one used in the theme song of anime? But this doesn't mean anything, it just expresses what you really think as accurately as possible!

Above all, as the word says, he really rushed in without considering the danger of life!


No more, my sister can't go to her wife anywhere! Onii-sama Take responsibility!


I'm not saying stupid things.

When I died, my legs started to get stronger. Moe is vitality!



"Onii-sama ... Flora-sama helped me."


Ekaterina said she noticed that Flora, who hadn't stood up yet, smiled and looked up at them.


Nodding, Alexei releases her arm holding her sister.

Then he stabbed one knee in front of Flora and took her hand.


"Miss Flora Czerny"


Respectfully call out and hang down to push his hand.



A beautiful young man kneeling on a beautiful girl!

What a fortune! Just one width painting!



Inwardly, Ekaterina is in full swing.


"Thank you very much for your courage to save my sister, and once again I want to apologize for my disrespect the other day. I was stupid."

"Such"


With his eyes rounded, Flora shakes his head. But Alexei went on to say.


"Our family, Yurunova, has received a grace that you can never return. Therefore, I would like you to take this oath."



Oath!

Certainly, the prince was also playing the game!



"I, Alexei, set Flora Czerny as Yurunova's friend, as Yurunova's master. Everyone in the name of Yurunova rejoices in his friend's happiness and fights his friend's enemy as his enemy. ..

Your enemy is my enemy, and your joy is my joy.

Thus, the head Alexei swears here. "



Wow ...

The blood of a reki-jo makes a noise in the Sengoku-like wording that seems to be a remnant of the founding period.



"His Excellency ...! Please don't worry. It's me who has the irreparable benefit to Ekaterina-sama. Don't kneel on me."

"You can't stand until you get the oath, because that's what the oath is."


Alexei gently says to Flora, who shakes her head. On the contrary, the calmness makes me feel the unwaveringness that even a lever cannot move.


"Wow, I understand. I will accept it. So please stand. Please stand."


Flora said in an embarrassed manner, and Alexei smiled a little. And when he stands up, he gently pulls Flora's hand.

With his eyes wide open, Flora clung to Alexei's hand and slowly stood up.



Oh, Onii-sama is nice! A beautiful man and a beautiful girl who really becomes a picture!


But ... this is ...

flag?

I wonder. I wonder what about…….


There must have been no route for the heroine to capture Onii-sama. But in the game Onii-sama didn't show up at this event. Unlike the game, he rushed in like this, so a new route was born?

Real romance was a disappointing woman with only black history, so I'm sorry if I deviate from the flow of the game.


If so, I'm happy for Onii-sama, but I'm still lonely ... I'm happy to be reborn as Onii-sama's younger sister. At least I wanted to capture Onii-sama in the game of the previous life.
