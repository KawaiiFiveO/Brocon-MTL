Let's take care of the roses

The angry Nonna boarded the office where Alexei was having a meeting with the butler for the day of the event, causing dissatisfaction with Ekaterina.

With the frozen light in his neon blue eyes, looking at his former grandmother's maid, Alexei said what he wanted to say, saying that Nonna, who was out of breath, grabbed her mouth.


"Did Ekaterina ask who you are, who is greater than your mistress?

I will answer. You are a bug. It's just a stupid insect that has lived on the tiger's fur for many years and lived warmly, and took advantage of it to think of itself as a tiger. "


Alexei repeats words to Nonna, who is stunned by the overly fierce words.


"Did you think I would appeal to you and make her like you? Did you really think I would allow her to bleed after her grandmother's death?

Anyone who served near my grandmother would know that I often gave up on my grandmother's waste. Every time my grandmother was furious, she was cursing me. What did you call There were various things. Cold blood. Disrespect, disrespect, mess that doesn't understand the pride of the aristocrats ... At the end, always disappear from your eyes.

Did you think I wanted to remake my kind-hearted sister like that grandmother? Fool "


Throwing away, Alexei looked at the butler.


"Graham. I'm sorry for this time."

"It doesn't really matter. We have all the evidence."


Alexei nods.

And he said to Nonna.


"Did you say Nonna Zares? I'll fire you.

I know I was embezzling payments to a trader who was in and out of my grandmother. If you refuse to dismiss, hand it over to the Imperial Capital Guard. Do you just go out or go to jail? You should choose "





The brothers and sisters stay overnight instead of returning to the dormitory because they have business at the Duke's residence for both weekends.

While having dinner with him, Alexei told Ekaterina that he had fired Nonna. Keep it simple, omitting detailed conversations.


"You didn't say anything to me because you're in a hurry right now. I'm sorry you've lost your mercy."

"I'm sorry ... Onii-sama is very kind to me, and I'm sorry. Onii-sama said that I was the mistress of Yurunova. I'm supposed to be my husband, but I'm sorry for putting a burden on Onii-sama because I'm immature. "


Come to think of it, the Duchess' acting role should have been done right away before he said he would help Onii-sama's work ...

I was thinking about checking that damn hag's dress and meeting the remnants of the side service.

But I'm sorry, it's still impossible. Even if I somehow know the role of the mistress, it is far from practical.

You can recover from studying at the school by reading a book, but you can't come to the front stage like home economics ... It must be a field where there isn't much historical material left in the previous life, so I don't have much knowledge. A family that has been around for 400 years seems to have its own customs.


Alexei smiled.


"It's a word that seems to be a strong sense of responsibility, but you don't have to worry about it. Graham is in charge of the inner part of the imperial residence. Butler. I'm just leaving it to you. "


Graham, who stands behind Alexei, bows. Around 60 years old, a little younger than his grandfather, he has beautiful silver hair and a neat appearance like a butler.


"But if you want, give the mistress the right authority."

"No, I would like Graham, who Onii-sama trusts, to take control of the imperial capital as it is. However, I would like to know that I am facing backwards.

Hey Graham, can you tell me little by little? "

"Of course, as you wish"


Graham bows respectfully to Ekaterina, who smiles.


"Rather, I would be grateful if Ojou-sama could properly supervise us as a mistress. The way it has been so far has been unavoidable. The kind Ojou-sama I think it's wonderful that your brothers and sisters can support the Duke's family with their support. "

"... I see. I was relying on it, but it's time to reduce Graham's burden."


Uh, right? In this world where the average life expectancy is not as long as in the previous life, Graham is about to retire ...?


"Ekaterina, if you really want it ... will you come back here with me this weekend and oversee the back with Graham? It's only after the end of the trip and calm down. Oh, there's an exam, so will it be after that? "

"Goodbye ..."


Kuu …….

so! The first exam schedule announced yesterday. It started the day after Yukiyuki!

……I throw it away. Onii-sama I'm sorry.


"Of course, I will do that. I would be happy if it helps Onii-sama."


Ekaterina smiles like a daughter, without belching an inward storm that seems to shed blood.


"Thank you .... Ekaterina, I want you to have a kind sister like you and tell me how happy I am."

"Well, Onii-sama! What a happy word! I'm sure you'll be surprised to find out how happy I am to be with Onii-sama."


After all, it was recommended from the previous life!


But I definitely don't want to know that my sister's contents are arasa or company slaves. If you say that you are kind or clever, it will hurt your heart because of fraud.

I'm not kind. I still understand that there is no way I can rely on the dismissed Nonna, but I don't think I'll follow him.


The name Nonna means "nineth". The fact that he was a high-class servant named a maid at the duke's house means that Nonna must have been born of an aristocrat. However, as the name implies, if you were born as the ninth child, you would have had no expectations or hopes since you were born.

Dowry is required for this society and marriage. Perhaps my brother and sister have used it up and can't prepare it. In fact, Nonna seems to have served that damn hag without getting married. Still, it doesn't mean that you will be taken care of at your parents' home for the rest of your life. I had nowhere to live in my parents' house, and being the maid of that damn hag was the luckiest thing in my life, and I would never have been thrown out in a bad mood.

My husband, who was clinging to me, died, and while my side service was being dismissed one after another, I tried to use me to continue sucking delicious juice. It's a long-standing style, and it's out of luck that I've been biting the mounting. Ekaterina, a naive daughter who has been imprisoned for many years, might have been swallowed by that madness (maybe Ekaterina in the game ...?), But there are a lot of arasa members here and there.

Until now, I wondered if I had no choice but to worship as that damn hag said, fraudulently save money, and live that way. When I imagine that, I feel sorry for Nonna.

However, the result must be accepted by the person himself. I shouldn't have been given a retirement allowance or a letter of introduction to get the next job, but it seems that the money I've saved wasn't taken away, so I want you to live the rest of your life.


…… For the first time, I realize that the hiring side is also troublesome.

Onii-sama was born and lived on the employer's side and took responsibility for it. I will respect you again.


Overseeing this huge mansion on behalf of the Duchess (the number of servants is close to three digits including the gardener ...?), Hospitality of the imperial family, etc. It is too great to talk to the common people in the previous life. I can't help but still sit down like an American crayfish.

I will do my best for Onii-sama!


Then, the next day, Ekaterina worked with a teacher of etiquette on special training in manners for the royal family.
