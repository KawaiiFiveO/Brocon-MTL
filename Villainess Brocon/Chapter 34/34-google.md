Care is important for roses

"Na ..."


Nonna opened her mouth with Pokan.


"What? Now ... vulgar? Did you say vulgar?"

"Yes, I said that. I don't feel the dignity of ordering more dresses than I need, giving up my duty as a member of the Duke's family and living in beauty on my own. Do it stupid and silly. "

"Well ... what a surprise!"


Raising his eyes, Nonna shouts.


"Grandmother, Alexander-sama would have been whipping here as a punishment! That word was as good as insulting the princess Alexander-sama!"

"Well scary. I'm glad I didn't have a grandmother."


Ekaterina distorted her mouth while laughing with her nose because she thought of something unpleasant. I don't think that damn hag would whip Onii-sama when he was little.

If you do, even if you die, it's a chorus.


"I don't have a grandmother anymore. Now that I don't have a grandmother or a mother, I'm the mistress of Yurunova. My husband, Onii-sama, said so. I'll decide what it's like. I'm not going to ask for your teaching. "


Nonna trembled with a trap.


"What do you think of the authority of the princess ... the authority of the imperial family? What do you think you are better than Alexander-sama ..."

"Once again, my grandmother isn't here anymore. And if you don't know, I'll tell you that your grandmother is no longer a princess since she was married to our house. Above all, you I'm not a princess. I wonder who you are, who is going to be greater than the mistress of Yurunova.

Oh, my servant. By the way, did you say anything about how to treat my servants? Should the servant who has a screaming mouth be struck with a whip? "


Ekaterina, who just flirted with her, regretted a little when she saw Nonna's face. The blue line on the forehead is at an unpleasant level.

Maybe this will attack you? I've never had a physical quarrel, but you're in your sixties, you're losing.


When I thought, Mina broke in between Ekaterina and Nonna.

With Ekaterina on his back, he is staring at Nonna. I wonder if I'm staring around my neck and imagining how much I should tighten it to stop breathing, as I did for Soiya trio someday.


Surprisingly, Nonna immediately changed her complexion in front of Mina. It's pale and back.


"Oh, Alexander-sama will never forgive you for putting such a filthy person on your side!

Stay away from me, demons! "


What?

Involuntarily Ekaterina summoned a fighter in her brain.

[What are you talking about]


"How many times do you intend to say the same thing? Your grandmother isn't here anymore.

And you, who are just servants, will not allow you to say anything about my side service. Mina is a much more enduring maid than you and others.

Thank you for your guidance. I'll be back. You don't have to follow me ─── Mina, let's go. "


Abandoned, Ekaterina turns her back.


(Ah, that damn hag's shit is too good to hear!)


For the month I lived in the Duke's residence, I was studying hard to prepare for school, and I only met Mina, who was newly hired as my caretaker, so I didn't notice it, but it's strange to the servants here. Seems to be mixed. Those who served near that damn hag's side.

It seems that if you get rid of it all at once, you will run out of manpower, and it seems that you are gradually dismissing and replacing it, but there are also people who refuse to take over and cling to it.


"Ojou-sama, do you want to get rid of that?"

"..."


Ekaterina had a hard time answering when Mina told her plainly.


"No. I think it will take some manpower to welcome the imperial family. That's why the butler may be in trouble if he's gone. After that, talk to Onii-sama and make a decision. I'll leave it to you. "

"Okay. ─── And Ojou-sama, I'm not a monster."


Mina said this too plainly, and Ekaterina smiled.


"Of course, Mina"

"But my mother's grandfather was a demon."

"..."


I had trouble answering again, but I was lightly convinced from the inside.


(Well, was Mina a person with demon blood?)


That's why it's so powerful that you can hug me as a princess and walk around. In this world, there are humanoid monsters, and sometimes we have children with humans.

But when you think about it, the Demon Dragon King transforms into a human being and becomes the target of the heroine's capture, so it's natural that there is a love affair between a demon and a human.


"That's right, I didn't know. If you've heard it and forgot it, I'm sorry."

"I don't think I was talking about it. When Ojou-sama came to the imperial capital, he suddenly collapsed and didn't say hello properly."

"Oh, that's right."


The memory of the previous life was restored, and I had the memory and personality of two people in my head. It hurts my head, and as soon as I try to move, it locks and my consciousness flies, so it was hard. It took me about three days to calm down and it was really good.


"It's not a monster, but the blood of the monster is drawn. Some people say this, as before. It seems that Yurumagna never uses something like me even at the Duke's house. Ojou-sama, don't you hate it? "

"Do you hate it?"


Well, I wonder what it is. I don't like Mina at all.

Is it because you like reading a lot of manga and novels that appear in different kinds in the previous life? It's a shame that people hate that kind of thing.

Well, if a stranger is a monster, I might be a little cautious, but Mina has been taking care of food, changing clothes, and everything else for another two months. Now that my grandfather isn't human.


"Oh, I remember. When Onii-sama wasn't on my side, I was thirsty but couldn't move and was struggling in bed. At that time, it was the first time I got up. Wow.

Remember that the hand that woke me up and gave me water was very gentle and comfortable. When I talked to him, I was a little surprised by the blunt way of speaking, but the touch was gentle, but I didn't care.

I don't think I hate Mina. "


Mina, who is always expressionless, smiled at this time.


"I remember. Ojou-sama thanked me for giving me some water.

Ojou-sama says thank you for the small things, even if the other person is a servant. I was surprised at first. "

"Isn't that normal?"


Leaning his neck, Hata and Ekaterina opened their eyes.


"Mina. Maybe Mina is also my escort?"

"I also serve"


Mina simply affirms.


"Is Mina strong?"

"It's strong"


This was also easily affirmed, and Ekaterina was shocked.

The thing is, Mina is ───


Battle maid! ︎

A beautiful woman who can do housework and has high fighting power, and also looks good in maid clothes. There was a creature close to me that I thought didn't actually exist!


Hmm, I have to confirm that!


"Mina! Is your salary enough?"

"What?"

"Because the maid's job alone is difficult from morning till night. And if you also have the role of an escort, I think you have to pay for two people!"


Appropriate compensation for labor!

Do not allow overtime work!


"You've got plenty, the Duke of Yurunova isn't a roar. Your Excellency is a generous person to spend money on."

"That's right. That was good."


For the first time, Mina broke her face to Ekaterina, who smiled relievedly.


"Ojou-sama is weird"

"Oh, it's been a while since I was told that."

"If you don't like me, I'll take care of Ojou-sama for a long time."

"Yes, please."


Thanks to such a conversation with Mina, Ekaterina almost forgot the discomfort she had in her conversation with Nonna.

Without Ekaterina's knowledge, Nonna was suicide bombing.
