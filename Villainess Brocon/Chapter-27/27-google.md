Information provision and reverse victory

In the otome game, the event of the appearance of the demon beast was over as long as the demon beast was defeated, and the heroine and the target of the capture soon returned to their original lives.

However, when you think about it, it is natural that the magic school has become a big fuss.


Armed imperial guards come and go in the school, creating a terrifying atmosphere.

It seems that a search is being conducted to find out if there is a monster lurking somewhere on the vast site, why the monster suddenly appeared, or if there is no clue as to why.


All classes were canceled and the students were instructed not to go out after returning to the dormitory, but Ekaterina, who witnessed the moment of the appearance of the demon beast, as well as Alexei and Mikhail, who faced each other directly, were asked to provide information.

However, Flora will have to appraise the magical power attribute again, and will be taken by an appraiser to take another action.

This happened between Ekaterina and Alexei over the information provided.




"I'll tell the guards. You should go back to the dorm and rest. It's the first time you've used that magical power, you must be tired."


Alexei said so, and Ekaterina was amazed.


"No, Onii-sama. I'm okay. I was the only one who was watching the moment when that demon beast appeared, and I have to tell you what I saw."


I want to provide information because I want to know why and how the demon beast appeared there. If you put a person in between, the information will inevitably deteriorate.

But Alexei shakes his head.


"No. You're not strong in the first place, what if you fall down again. You have to be more aware and take good care of your body."


No, please delete that sickness setting anymore. There are other causes for the fall ... I want to say, but I can't say what the cause is.


"Onii-sama ... I think it is an important duty to cooperate with the investigation so that this kind of thing does not happen again. Behavior that humiliates the name of the Duke of Yurunova, such as taking a rest alone without fulfilling the duty. Then "


When I appealed to the pride of the three great dukes, Alexei's eyes were a little calm.


"You were fine enough, Ekaterina. I confronted the demon beast alone to let the classmates escape and showed courage and spirit. I'm proud of my noble sister, worthy of Yurunova's name, so I'm off. Please "


"Onii-sama"

"Ekaterina"


Alexei's voice becomes harsh.


"You were fine. That's for sure.

But at the same time it was reckless. Don't you know? "


U ...


"You have never been trained to fight demons. On the contrary, you have only recently learned how to control normal magic. If you calmly judge, you should have escaped. Guarantee that I and your Highness will rush. It wasn't anywhere. "


UU…….

Well, that's right ... I couldn't help it because of the game!

Wow, as the prince said, he is being preached by Onii-sama ⁉︎

And I'm drooling, right? Even when I was a company slave in my previous life, I said what I wanted to say to my boss and client if there was a counterargument!

What's the reason for your good voice? Is it because the content is solid and correct? No, it ’s not.

It's a spirit.

None of my previous bosses or clients could speak word for word with such a spirit. The prince said that he had been preaching more than adults since he was a child, but this is it! Onii-sama, are you really 17 years old ⁉︎


"Did you think ... even a little?"


Suddenly, Alexei's voice shook.


"I was surprised at the sudden sign of the demon beast and looked out from the classroom window. There was a demon beast and you in the classroom. While even the teacher was running away, my sister was trying to confront alone. What do you think I felt when I saw it? "


Ah ...


"I thought I'd lose you. How scary I was. I'm not afraid of the demon beast, but if you ... something happened to you ...

At that time, I saw a demon beast attacking you behind the collapsing earthen wall. I thought I couldn't help. That moment ... "


Alexei's voice is painful, and Ekaterina is breathtaking.


"If I lost you, I thought I'd freeze this useless heart. I don't want to live anymore."

"Onii-sama!"


Cut off life with his own magic, which is a method of death of a nobleman in this country, much like the seppuku of a samurai in the previous life.


"I have no one but you. If I lose you, I will be alive.

Think about it. I told you, if you have something, I can't live either. You are my life. You hold my life. That ... "


"Onii-sama ……?"


"Think ..."


No ah ah! Onii-sama, crying ⁉︎


"I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'll never do it again! Don't cry the year!"


Ekaterina is half crying as she jumps at Alexei.


"Onii-sama is my life! Onii-sama is the most important. I can do anything for Onii-sama. Onii-sama is my happiness ~ ~ ~ But ~ ~ ~ Onii-sama is ~ ~ ~

"..."

"I can't forgive myself! I'm sorry Onii-sama ~"


Alexei says nothing.


Hmm?


Ekaterina quickly left Alexei and looked up at her brother's face.


"Onii-sama are laughing!"

"Disagreeable……"


Alexei shakes his head, but his face is laughing no matter how he looks. Looks very happy.


"It's terrible! You cheated ⁉︎"

"No, just you are too much"

"You're laughing! A liar!"


I was about to cry seriously!

Wow! What should I do!


I'll do it this way!


Ekaterina reaches out and swirls Alexei's hair.


In retaliation that was too childish, Alexei finally burst into laughter. I'm doing it with my head down a little to make it easier for my sister, and there's no retaliation.


...... I'm full after 10 seconds to shave my hair.

Or rather, I can't stand the stupidity of what I'm doing, and my hands stop.


"..."


Puffy, Ekaterina let go of her brother's hair. It's embarrassing as arasa, but there are times when I want to swell.


"Are you okay?"


From under the messy bangs, Alexei asks. Brighter light than usual is dancing in the neon blue eyes.

Why do you seem to be happy there? That kind of sweet smile, when did your facial muscles start doing such a good job? Expressionless setting Where did you go? -Smiley!


"……sorry"


Ekaterina reaches out and repairs her messy hair with a hand comb. Alexei squinted.


"I'm sorry for your concern. I'll never do that again."

"Yup"


The heroine, Flora, woke up to her magical power and cleared the event, so it should no longer be possible to enter the imperial destruction route where the demon beasts attack one after another. So you don't have to fight the demon beast anymore.

...... Should be.


"But ... Onii-sama, no matter how close you are, it's scary to go back to the dormitory alone. Onii-sama's side is the most reassuring. So, let's talk to the guards. Can you please? "


"..."


After a short while, Alexei sighed.

Alright, a come-from-behind victory.


"... I'm good at myself, you're a really smart girl.

all right. I'll send it to the dormitory later. "


If you are a member of society, you should give up once or twice if you pass the request.

I should have said this from the beginning.

I learned!
