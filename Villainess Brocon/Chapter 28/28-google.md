Dojo and Azalea's Azumaya

Alexei couldn't beat his sister, but next was the only one.

A meeting room, which is one size smaller than the room that Alexei uses as an office, was assigned to the Imperial Capital Guard for questioning, and when I passed through it, I wore a guard uniform. Along with the three, the principal (correctly the school director) and the deputy school director are also on standby.


I saw this astringent look as a complaint. It seems that the students are trying to say that it is dangerous to confront the demon beast alone. I may have to say it from a standpoint, but I would like you to forgive me if possible because it was force majeure. Maybe Onii-sama knew this and tried to let me go home.


As soon as Mikhail, Alexei, and Ekaterina sat on the couch, Alexei took the lead.


"Waiting for a report"


The school director who was saying something solidifies.

I understand my feelings. Onii-sama, it's not a student line. The line of the boss who is a little polite.


"Ah ... what is a report ..."

"The current status of the survey. What kind of survey are you conducting and what do you know or do not know?

There will be no significant progress yet. I'm not looking for results, but I'd like to know the policy. "


My boss ...


"No ... even though it's a policy.

Anyway, it happened at the school, so please leave it to us. "

"I'm not going to take command, but your Highness is in charge of the school now. How would you like to tell His Majesty about this situation? If you're going to tell him in the end It will be necessary to report to His Highness on the spot and as it progresses.

Also, that demon beast appeared in a class in which my sister Ekaterina participated. As the Duke of Yurunova, I have no choice but to be interested. Please be aware that you are watching the investigation as the Duke of Yurunova, not as a student. "


His Majesty, His Majesty, the Duke's family.

The pressure of Royal & Noble is amazing.

The director of the school looks pale ... I don't want to be told what to do with His Majesty. I sympathize with you.


Looking at the deputy director of the school who had turned down, Alexei looked up and turned to the three members of the Imperial City Guard.


"I'm sorry I'm late to get into the main subject. I'd like to ask for information about the appearance of the demon beast."

"Huh"


Three people stretch their backs.

Already, the turn of Onii-sama all the time. Even though he is a student, he is a boss. As expected, Onii-sama.


Suddenly, Mikhail, sitting over Alexei, was looking at me and glanced at me.

It looks like saying [ne].

Ekaterina quickly turned away and focused on the guards.


What is [ne]? [Hey] I made eye contact with a handsome guy.

Did you say that Onii-sama's preaching was more enduring than the old days when adults got angry? I wonder if it has been like this for a long time. Still, Onii-sama when I was little would have been cute. n/a.

However, the prince, villainess, is so close.

I don't know what to do because you're a good boy. destruction flag scary.




For the next three days, the Imperial Capital Guard searched the school thoroughly to see if there were any other demon beasts hidden or if there were any traces of rituals, but nothing like that came out. I heard it wasn't there.


"It was found that that kind of demon beast is rare, but it has appeared in lake areas. However, there is no evidence that someone carried the demon beast caught in the lake area to the imperial capital, and a survey inside the school Will continue to scale down, but in the future he will investigate the summoning technology that is said to have existed in the Astra Empire. It seems that Yurumagna has offered full cooperation to investigate the summoning technology. "


Alexei told me when he received the report.

The report was reported in the school's conference room, where he summoned Ekaterina and Flora on his way back to the dormitory and talking at the eastern store near the girls' dormitory.


Beside the three, the maid Mina and her servant Ivan. Ivan said Mina should wait in the dormitory anyway, but Mina insisted that she was on the side of Ojou-sama. On the day of the appearance of the demon beast, Mina, who rarely distorted her cool beauty and burned a quiet anger saying "I wasn't on your side when Ojou-sama was in danger ...", has since been the shadow of Ekaterina. Do not try to leave like.

In addition, several guards were watching them in a long distance, following them to guard the traffic to and from Alexei's dormitory.


In addition, I think that this eastern store also appeared in the otome game. It's a graceful structure, and the surrounding azaleas are in full bloom now. There, the neat Alexei and the two beautiful girls surrounding the small table were just like a painting.


"To be clear, you can't expect any further progress, but why Yurumagna?"

"Magna has had a research institute on the Astra Empire since its inception. The wealth of literature is considered to be one of the best in the world. It must be a huge fortune."

"Oh dear……"


That is the Mito Tokugawa family.

I always think that the three great dukes are similar to the Tokugawa Gosanke, but it seems that you can individually assign which duke to which daimyo.


The Mito Tokugawa family has been compiling a history book called [Dainihonshi] endlessly since he was the model for the national drama. It's a myth that the money spent on it is said to be one-third of the GDP of the Mito Domain. When applied to Ibaraki Prefecture's GDP, it is over 1 trillion yen.

Also, the Mito Tokugawa family seemed to be very poor because they set the stone height higher than the original stone height (that is, income) in order to balance the style of the house with the other three families. The Yurumagna family seems to be putting pressure on their finances not only by the Astra Empire Research Institute but also by maintaining the Great Knights at the time of the opening of the country, and the spirit of encouraging martial arts and the nostalgia of returning to the Astra era. I think that the Mito clan seems to be a principle. It's an individual image.


Since the founder of Yurumagna, Pavel, was a Takebe person, he must be excellent not only in martial arts but also in writing! It seems that it started with a good ambition. The study of the Astra Empire is one of the most prestigious academic disciplines, and it seems to be Magna's pride itself, but ... I feel like I can't do it.


And Yuruseiin, which has a port, is the Owari Tokugawa family, and Yurunova is the Kishu Tokugawa family, which has abundant forest resources.

It's the self-satisfaction of a reki-jo who doesn't really care.


"I'm worried that I don't understand why the demon beast appeared, but Flora-sama was awakened to her magical power. That kind of thing will never happen again."

"Oh, that's right."


Flora turns red in the eyes of the brothers and sisters.


"I hope it helps you like that."

"Don't worry. It is said that the activity of the demon beast will be calmed down just by the existence of the person who awakens to the magical attribute [holy] in the empire. It is a pleasure for all the people of the empire. , Flora-sama is not responsible for anything. I hope you continue to live as usual. "


so. The magical attribute of Flora has been revealed.

The attribute is [Holy].

An ultra-rare attribute, whether or not one person appears in a generation.

I knew it from the otome game, but when I found out, I was impressed!


This did not appear in the otome game, but the sacred magical attribute possession was worshiped in the Astra Empire, and because it is often possessed by women, it is called a saint in some times, and it is a powerful demon of the Genryu class. It seems that he played the role of a shrine maiden to calm the beast.

So you shouldn't have to feel that scary anymore!

After that, if Flora and the prince stick together, the destruction flag measures are perfect!


...... Yes, I believe ...

Come to think of it, it was only the Prince route that I had done in my previous life.

I'm doing something different from the game, so there is a possibility that a different route will be born.

I don't think it's a little ...


"Thank you, Ekaterina-sama. However, it seems that there is no other person who has the magical power of the Holy, so it seems that there is no choice but to devise the magical power control by relying on the literature.

Still, it was said that the magical power of Holy is better because it is famous for its existence and has a lot of literature. If it is a true rare attribute with almost no literature, you have to devise a control method yourself, or you may not notice it as a unique attribute in the first place.

Therefore, I would like to thank you for reading the literature and devise your own magic control. "

"Flora-sama is fine. Those who have rare magical powers have such a hard time."


As expected, Flora is serious.

If you think about it, even in the training ground of this school, the attributes with a large number of people are better equipped. Whether or not there is one person in a generation, even a teacher can't help but understand how to teach.


"The Yurunova family may also have material on the magical power of the Holy. I hear that they once stayed in the Duchy to wipe out the beasts. Let's find out."

"Thank you. Someday ... I will do my best to help everyone at Yurunova."

"Thank you"


Since the damage of the demon beast is great in the Yurunova territory, the holy magical attribute holder who exerts power to calm and exterminate the demon beast is useful. It's a win-win relationship.


"Yes, Ekaterina. I was a tutor who taught you how to deal with monsters, but I was curious when I showed that letter to the Knights. I might hire him as a staff member of the Yurunova Knights."

"Oh dear!"


Mr. Mardu, from tutor (non-regular employment) to knights (regular employment)?

Congratulations!


"Mr. Mardu is an excellent person. It seems that there is a small Ojou-sama, and I think that if you get a stable job, your family will be happy. Onii-sama will also give you a mouthful. Please

"If you say so, let's do it. He's a kind child who cares about the tutor's family."


Next to the smiling Alexei, Flora is also smiling.

No, it's normal to care about the lives of people you know. There was a word in the previous life that even if the sleeves rub against each other, it is a prolific edge.

I wonder if it's a little different in a class society.


Oh no, it's not. What are you talking about now?

Onii-sama's younger sister's evaluation is just very sweet, yeah.
