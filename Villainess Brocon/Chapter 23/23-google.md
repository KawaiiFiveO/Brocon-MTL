Although it is villainess, I will participate in the event

I woke up early on that day.

As I wake up on the bed and look back at the letter I had on the bedside, Mina enters the bedroom and opens her eyes small.


"Good morning, Mina"

"Good morning, Ojou-sama. It's early today."

"I woke up"


Mina opened the curtains and Ekaterina squinted at the glare of the rising sun.

It looks like it will be fine today.


"Is there anything today?"

"Well, I had my first class. It's magical control, but it's my first practical skill. So I read back the advice I received from Dr. Mardu. You see, the tutor who delivered the sweets to Mina. teacher"

"It's a teacher with a little lady. She was overjoyed at the sweets. That teacher, Ojou-sama, paid a reward for one question, so I was very grateful. No "

"Teacher's knowledge is for sale. It's a legitimate reward."


No, when I was doing SE in my previous life, I often got caught up in a phone call from a client in my previous job and took a lot of time asking questions. I'm not a maintenance person and I'm already in a new project, can't I do this? I was told to fix it so that I could do it.

Knowledge and skills are not free!

Pretend to be a person and look back at me. In particular, this teacher, who is from an aristocrat with magical power, has fallen and is a tutor, and he remembers the fall of the commoners in the game and is struck by himself. I have a small child.


"I don't do my best. The teacher praised Ojou-sama because he has great magical power, so the school class is an easy win."

"Thank you, Mina. I just want to be well prepared."


The teacher is wondering even in the letter. Sat attributes are not often required to have such an attack technique in class.

Even so, he politely answered the variation of the attack that he asked for root digging and leaf digging. Thanks teacher.


Because, if it's the same as the game, the first lesson to learn the practical skill of magic control should have an event that has a serious effect on the imperial destruction flag.




The content of the event is the appearance of a demon beast.

A powerful demon beast appears when trying to start a magic control class in the training ground of the schoolyard. The heroine must join forces with the rushing prince to repel the demon beast and awaken to his magical power.

If you can't clear this event, the imperial extinction flag will be set. Eventually, the Demon King invades the Imperial Palace and the Imperial Palace is trampled.

So I'll do my best to clear the event!



I should say that.


Now that I have been reborn in this world and have been living in school for almost a month, I think.

A demon beast really appears here ...?



It seems that the magic school, or the entire center of the imperial capital, and the demon beasts haven't appeared for hundreds of years.

That's why that event, in the previous life, suddenly a huge bear appears near the Yasuda Auditorium of the University of Tokyo and rampages.

Just as bears live in Japan, demons live in the empire. But it's just forests, mountains, lakes, and never goes out into the city. Even if you go back to the Edo period, there were no bears in the flower Edo period.


Is it possible to summon only the demon beast? I thought, but it seems that the current empire does not have that technology.

It is said that there was such a technology in the huge empire called Astra (existence like the Roman Empire of the previous life, the hometown of the heart for the empire and neighboring countries), which prospered around a thousand years ago and boasted several times the print of the Yurugrand Empire. There is a story, but it seems that the details have been lost.

So I have no idea how the demon beast will appear here.


When I was thinking about how to clear this event, I thought that even if I made up for some reason, I would like to have an armed knights placed so that the students would not have to fight with a round waist. The game didn't say anything about why the demon beast appeared, and I couldn't come up with a reason to make such an arrangement.

A demon beast should appear, so let's say I tried to mess with it.

You can't believe it for sure.

At the same level as the office work of the University of Tokyo, if you say "I'm planning to have a bear around your Yasuda Auditorium today, please arrange for a hunting club", you must only say "Huh?" I can't get it.

Therefore, it is absolutely impossible to place the Knights. I think Onii-sama will worry about your mental health.


Also, if you make arrangements for the Knights and make it different from the game, it seems that your fate has been twisted, and instead of the game event not happening, a worse catastrophe will occur ... Then I got scared.

I can't say it's impossible!


So ... I have no choice but to do what I can.

Repel the demon beast of the event with all the magical power.




And now Ekaterina is in the lab with the whole class.


The training ground is only a light division of the schoolyard, but it is quite large. It seems that all four sides of the tennis court can be taken. There is a fountain with graceful sculptures blowing water, bushes of shrubs, flower beds, and rows of bonfires. It must be for practical skills of soil, water, and fire, which are overwhelmingly magical attributes. There is also a lot of wind, but this does not require any special equipment. There are various other attributes such as ice, light, darkness, and lightning, and some have multiple attributes by themselves.


Since the magic control class, which has been a classroom lecture since enrollment, is the first practical skill, there are various facial expressions for those who are enthusiastic, those who are depressed, and those who are students.

As long as they are admitted to the Magic Academy, they all have magical powers that meet the standards, but there are individual differences. It is unavoidable that some people are happy to show their magical power in practice and others are not. Even if the family is low or financially difficult, if the person's magical power is strong, good marriage and adoption can be expected, so the second son and third son who can not succeed the house are urgent.


(No, there was a story in a previous life novel that desperately searched for a place to enter a son-in-law. Samurai and aristocrats all end up together.)


Looking around with that in mind, I noticed that Flora's expression was a little stiff.


"Flora-sama, do you have any concerns?"

"No ... I'm sorry."


I remembered with a smile.


"Oh, the attributes of magical power have not been determined."


It has been measured that her magical power is strong at the MAX level. However, the magical power attribute of the heroine is [? ].

So, when Soiya trio heard this word, he started to say it.


"Well, I don't know the attributes. Isn't it wrong to enroll?"

"Yes, that's right."


The same thing as harassment was said in the game. …… To villainess Ekaterina.

However, this student Ekaterina laughs normally. Listen to the class and you guys.


"The teacher said that rare magical power attributes are often not determined immediately by measurement. I'm looking forward to finding out what kind of attributes they are."


In the game, the heroine had a special feeling, but when he came to this world, it was often the case that he had a rare attribute.


"Yes, I'm looking forward to it, but I'm a little scared."

"Maybe that's the case. I'm a little envious because I'm the most common soil attribute."


Flora, I'm sorry. I know your magical attributes. But I can't say it.

I'm sorry I have no choice but to say something white and bland.


But ... the game event is where the heroine and the prince work together to defeat the demon beast.

When I was playing a game on my smartphone, I could attack by hitting the buttons on the screen repeatedly.


If a demon beast actually attacks here, how will Flora, who doesn't even know her magical power attributes, fight? ⁉︎

I can't!

So don't wake up to your magical power and pretend to be a crazy game!




"Then, let's start the practical skill. Everyone, please come here."


The teacher calls out and Ekaterina returns to me.

At that time.

I felt that my skin was tingling.


(?)


I felt something. Ekaterina looks back, not knowing what it is.

In front of the fountain, I saw a shimmer like a heat haze. When I squinted at what it was,


The heat haze spreads widely,


A black flame appears and spreads on its core,


Shake the air with a flutter


The space is torn.



Guoooooo and the roar struck my ears.


Gray body close to black. Although it has the shape of a carnivorous beast that resembles a wolf, it is covered with metallic scales. Three rows of fangs like a shark, peeking out of a roaring mouth.

I couldn't compare it to a bear, even a black bear seems cute, estimated to be 3 meters long! That's right, the bear's largest grizzly bear was certainly that much!


Really, really, it came out.

The demon beast of the game.


It's dangerous, it's dangerous, it's far more dangerous than you can see on your smartphone. It was such a big ⁉︎

It's not a difficult level to come out in such an early stage, isn't it, a big idiot of the game!
