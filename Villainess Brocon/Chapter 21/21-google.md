Insert story ~ Brother and sister two states ~

A little back in time, after Ekaterina ran away from Alexei.


After a short break after the afternoon class, Alexei covered his eyes with his elbowed hands on his desk and sighed several times.


In the previous lesson, Alexei was messed up. It's completely above the sky, and I don't even know what I was asked, let alone answer when I was hit by a teacher. I was stunned when the stunned teacher said "it's okay". It's an unacceptable blunder for him, who has always had a lesson attitude since he entered school.


Next to such Alexei, there was a large male student who appeared.


"Hey, Duke. What happened to you today. What happened?"


Say mysteriously. With fiery redheads, golden eyes, tall and stunning muscles, he is Nikolai Krymov. He is the son of the Count family.


Nikolai has a carefree personality and speaks to Alexei, who is estranged from teachers when she is not good at it, in the same way as she treats everyone else.

There is no class change at the magic school, and it has been the same for three years. I knew that some people shadowed Alexei, who had been in the Duchy's territory since he was in the first grade, in the sense of ridiculing him. But Nikolai is the only one who calls her face-to-face like a nickname.

I didn't blame it because I had a loan to the Krymov family, which the Yurunova family once owed. However, even after actually inheriting the title, the [Duke], who is still called by Nikolai's deep voice, feels like his own name, which is different from the title, and is no longer unpleasant.


Alexei secretly thinks Nikolai is the exact opposite of herself. Even if you don't intend to do that, Alexei makes the air tense just by stepping into the place, but Nikolai seems to make the place warm and peaceful just by being there.


And now Alexei was too weak. So I just said it.


"... I made my sister cry."

"What?"


Nikolai makes her eyes round.


"Hey, why? My sister is a creature that's crying all the time. If I leave it alone, I'll be bad and I'll be hit by my dad or bag. He sees it and makes me crazy. "


He also seems to have a younger sister, and in the second half he was just a murmur.


It's strange that the Count or Countess [father] [bag] [hit], but the Krymov family is special. It is a family that conveys the secret technique of mating and training mixed-race horses with demon beasts. While many aristocrats throw even the rule of the territory to the caretaker, the head of the Krymov family is known to work on a vast ranch and pick up foals by hand during the birth season. And the Countess of the present generation is said to be a woman who was the daughter of a powerful Marquis family, but she liked horses too much and rushed to the Krymov family to make a wife, and was called [special talent] by the previous Countess.


Said Nikolai, "Ah," as if he remembered something.


"No, I'm here to be your sister. Isn't she a beautiful girl with indigo hair and purplish blue eyes?

Yeah, it was an amazing beauty that was so mature that I couldn't think of it as a freshman. It was so fair that it seemed to be transparent, and it was so thin that it seemed to break. At first glance, it seemed difficult to approach, but when I told him where you were, he politely thanked me. It feels good, but it's kind of glittering and elegant, that's amazing.

I'm sorry, that is a different creature from my sister. If that's my sister, we're a monkey. "


Hahaha, Nikolai laughs.


"Beautiful women competing for one or two in this year's freshmen are making noise. It seems that they are called the blue rose prince. There is another beautiful woman who stands out, and that is Sakuraka.

Anyway, why did you make such a graceful sister cry? Even though I cherish it so much that I'm depressed. "

"... There was something wrong with my friendship. The classmate I brought with me as a friend had an unbalanced status ..."


"Huh"


The answer seemed surprising, and Nikolai groaned.


"When I told you not to go out, I didn't like it and cried.

Well, if you're the Duke of Yurunova, you'll have to be wary of strange things coming in ... but your sister hasn't known that for a long time, right? "

"That child ... didn't get along very well. For a long time ... he was resting."

"Oh, by the way, after your entrance ceremony, I was late saying that my sister had fallen. Maybe I'm weak, it's more and more different from my monkey.

But then, wouldn't that classmate of different status be the first friend to make? "


Alexei opens his eyes to the words.

That was exactly what it was supposed to be. Far from being friends, when he was in the territory, he was reported to be so open to anyone that his servants near him rarely even heard Ekaterina's voice.

After coming to the imperial capital, Ekaterina began to speak brightly and misleadingly, making it difficult to even imagine what was reported. So I was forgotten.


"If you say that kind of thing tightly, you'll get confused if you're not good at it.

Was that classmate an unfavorable type who couldn't go out with him? "

"Disagreeable……"


I remember Flora, who talked about her origin without being humbled. It made me feel more dignified than a poor aristocrat.


"But ... I wanted her to learn about aristocratic relationships. I don't know anything yet, she's too kind. I got a network that would protect her ..."


Alexei is mumbling. He is as alert as someone close to him, and he knows it.


I suddenly thought.

--- What would your grandfather do?

Grandfather Sergei used it regardless of his status if he was capable. But that's the story of his subordinates. His grandfather's best friend Forli was the third son of the Marquis family and later cut off from his parents' home, but he was born with a family worthy of a friend.


But ... my grandfather has a half-brother. Alexei's great uncle, Isaac. I hear that my grandfather and grand uncle are close brothers even if their mothers are different, and that my grandfather loved his younger brother, who was five years younger, from an early age. A little weird but kind, Isaac is now a well-known scholar and interacts with people of all statuses. I should have referred to my grandfather.


Even if Alexei brought a friend from the commoner to his grandfather, it was unthinkable for him to say anything to his friend.


Yes, my grandfather won't talk. Thoroughly excluding friends of different status ...


Alexei grabbed his bangs.


(Ekaterina ... you were right)


An angry and screaming voice revives in my ears like a fiery fire.

It is my grandmother who dismisses me.


[I oppressed my mother ... it's the same as my grandmother ...]


He always used his grandfather as a guide, and after his death he intended to protect the Duke of Yurunova from the tyranny of his grandmother. I, not my father, took over the duke family from my grandfather. I had such pride.

But before I knew it, I was dyed by my grandmother's thoughts.


She wouldn't ask me to hold her hand anymore.




I was hit on my shoulder.

"Duke, Hey Duke, what's wrong. Yurunova. Alexei"

Called by Nikolai, Alexei returns to me.


"Is it okay, I'm pale. Isn't it sick?"

"No. I'm fine."


Nikolai smiles at Alexei, who shakes his head stubbornly.


"It feels like the Ice Rose has melted and withered."

"What……?"

"I don't know, it's a nickname that some girls are dedicated to.

Well, don't get too depressed. Brothers and sisters are brothers and sisters for the rest of their lives, there are times when it gets a little rippling. I think it's okay to forgive my friendship for three years at the school. Unless there is a fear that the friend will be imbued with something strange. "


For a moment, Alexei smiled at the edge of her lips.


"... It's about cooking."

"Ah?"

"He learned how to cook from his friend and brought it to the office. He asked me to eat properly."

"Is there such a younger sister in this world?"


Nikolai growls with a straight face.


"My monkey will eat as much as I have if I have rice. But when I ate his sweets, I swung a pitchfork and chased around the garden."


A pitchfork is a huge fork that can kill people and is used to scoop grass on a ranch.


"Unlike monkeys, your sister is an angel. I don't think you're worried too much. You might be worried about it, so why don't you talk a little tomorrow?"

"Yes ... that's right."


Alexei confuses his words, as if the immediate decision in the office was a lie.

I was scared to be rejected and didn't feel like being called out.




next morning.

Alexei appeared quite as usual and made Nikolai laugh.


"Good morning, Duke. Looks fine."

"Oh, good morning. Yesterday's case, but after school, my sister visited me and solved it. I made a noise."


Alexei says clearly.

Then he looked down and said in a soft voice. Embarrassed.


"Thank you for your advice ... Thank you for yesterday."

"Oh"


Nikolai laughed with a grin and immediately frowned and rubbed the back of his head.


"?What happened"

"Ah, my eyes are a little stuck ... Nothing."


The women's dark battle over Alexei, which Nikolai is not familiar with, seems to be the momentum of flying bullets to boys. No, it's a dark fight, or because it's too difficult for anyone to approach the person directly, it seems that there is a lot of excitement that I do not understand if there is something in Alexei these days, as it became incomprehensible due to checks and agreements. .. A smile at the entrance ceremony.

It's a difficult thing.


"Well, it was good."


Nikolai said Alexei nodded with a faint smile, and a silent scream echoed in the classroom.
