Bomb and apple pie

This is a while after the reconciliation between Ekaterina and Alexei.


Forli, who was considering planting trees in the Duchy, came to the office to report on the situation.

This time too, we are in a power lunch state before the lunch prepared by Ekaterina and Flora.


"First of all, I identified the areas that were cut down but have not been cleared due to various reasons. I would like to make those areas the first target for tree planting.

This time, we will transplant the seedlings that grow naturally in the forest. Due to the appearance of the Genryu, logging has stopped in some areas, so there are some logging people who are in trouble because they have no work. If you can get the labor cost, I would definitely like to do it.

In the future, we will recommend the cultivation of seedlings to some farmers. Even those who have only thin agricultural land may be able to grow saplings. In addition to black dragon cedar, I think it is better to mix walnuts, cherry wood, and other trees that are edible and can be sold as furniture materials. Black dragon cedar sells well, but it takes 20 years, preferably 50 years, to be used as a building material, so I thought we needed something that could be sold sooner. "


Well, Forli-san, you can!

It puts vague ideas into reality. At the same time, it is said to have measures against unemployment, poverty, and famine.

Furthermore, although most of the trees planted in Japan are cedar, it goes without saying that there are harmful effects such as pollinosis. It has low water retention and is not very good for the ecosystem. If you plant a mixture of cedar and hardwood, you won't have any problems.


"Are you thinking about buying seedlings?"

"Mr. Left. I thought about exempting growers from taxes, but I think it would be better if they could get money in an easy-to-understand manner. Somehow, the idea of ​​planting trees is new. Everyone thinks it's better to plant trees, so I think we need to show the benefits of planting trees together. "


This is also reasonable. Many people reject just because they have never done it. He said he had a hard time every time he released a new system in the SE era.


"What do the people of the forest think?"


Hmm?


"While it seems doubtful that it will work, efforts to stop deforestation are appreciated."

"Well, Genryu is said to respect the people of the forest. I'm hoping that this attempt will not be transmitted from the people of the forest to the dragon."


"Oh, Onii-sama, Lord Forli. What kind of people are the people of the forest?"

"Oh, didn't you know Ekaterina?"


The people of the forest are ethnic minorities who live in the forest of the Duchy, and they are said to be special people who do not settle but move in the forest and do not interact much with other people.


Is it an elf? But there shouldn't be any elves in this world, so I think it's like Sanka, a mountain people who used to live in Japan in the previous life.


"The people of the forest are divided into several tribes, and the head of the largest tribe is the wife of Forli."

"Eh ⁉︎"

"Well ... well, it's on the left."


Forli nods as he clears his throat.

Born as the third son of the Marquis family, Forli was invited by his grandfather Sergei, who became a friend at the Magic Academy, to visit the Duchy. He seems to have fallen in love with his daughter.

And he was isolated from his parents' Marquis family and became a subordinate of his grandfather until now.


What is that amazing! The Romance!

I inadvertently looked at Flora-chan, but both girls had glittering eyes. Even the contents of arasa are powerful enough to make you a maiden.


Clearing his throat again, Forli eats lunch.


Today is a pie. Meat pie, mushroom pie, gratin pie with plenty of vegetables, apple pie.

It's not something that can be made just during the lunch break, but in fact, Ekaterina and Flora stop by the kitchen for a short break in the morning after school or before the start of work the day before, and prepare it. Recently, it has become a daily routine to review classes while having tea every night in the dormitory and consult with tomorrow's recipes to take a break. The kitchen staff also wanted to know Flora's recipes and helped in exchange, and as a result, lunch became more and more elaborate.


"... I have a nostalgic taste."


Forli said and Flora smiled.


"This is the recipe of the Baroness. His pie is really great. I think he's close to Sir Forli, so it might feel nostalgic."

"Mrs. Czerny ... Do you say your name is Natasha?"


That being said, Flora is stunning.


"Yes, that's right. Mrs. Natasha is named ... Do you know that?"

"Miss Natasha, the daughter of Count Natasha Merno at the time, was in the same grade at this magic school."


Seriously!


"I was in the same class as Joseph Czerny, and I met Miss Natasha through him. Like both of them, they loved cooking and rented a corner of the kitchen to make and behave. It was very delicious. So it was a scramble. Duke Sergei secured it every time. It was a big eater. "


Last, last. I was really close.


"Joseph and Miss Natasha went down on the eve of the graduation ceremony, but it was actually Prince Sergei who set it up."


"... What?"

"e?"

"What did you say?"


The bomb fell.




"Oh, I'm sorry, the meaning is a little ... Elopement? Elopement? Those two? That calm two, no way ..."


Flora is a mess.


"Wait, Forli. What is your grandfather?"

"You said that Flora-sama's parents-in-law and grandfather had such a deep relationship ...? No, but no way."


Alexei and Ekaterina are also confused. Wait, villainess and heroine! Is it okay to have such a connection!


"Joseph was a quiet and sober person at first glance, but he had a strong core and kept saying that he didn't like anything he didn't like. Duke Sergei seemed to like it. Can I say that I was there?

I don't know how I met Miss Natasha, but when I was in the second grade, I already seemed to be an inseparable friend. It's not a flashy color love, but it seems that these two people can only be thought of as being together for the rest of their lives.

However, Miss Natasha's parents' family prepared another marriage and did not allow her to marry Joseph, so all the alumni decided to let them escape to Czerny's territory. This is the greatest memory of my student life. "


Is it a big runaway of students? The mastermind has a light sympathy for the tracers of the three great dukes, teachers and parents ...


"It seems that Miss Natasha finally baked an apple pie as a thank-you to everyone, but Duke Sergei who received it ate the whole hall. When I knew it, I hit him unintentionally."


Cho …….


"... I remember my grandfather didn't like the kind of pie very much."

"It seems that I ate too much, and I said that I would have heartburn later. After that, I didn't like to eat."


Are you sure ...


I mean, eh ⁉︎

I've never met my grandfather, but I've seen portraits at the Duke's residence. There was also a two-shot with 10-year-old Onii-sama, and I was crazy about Onii-sama's beautiful boy, but my grandfather seems to be anthropomorphic of dignity, but even a super dandy nice old man ... ….


Even though it was a young episode, there are too many gaps!


Novak and his friends are laughing bitterly beside their grandchildren who are holding their heads. For them, Sergei was a benefactor who complemented him and a boss of sternness itself, but he knew that there was more than that.


"Forli, grandfather and Baron Czerny ... why didn't you say the other day?"

"I thought that Waka-kun should make a decision. How about being special because of the interaction with Duke Sergei?"

"..."


It was Alexei, which had no unusual noise. Had I allowed Ekaterina and Flora to make friends with my grandfather, I wouldn't have been able to rethink my thinking.


"I was wondering what happened to Joseph and Miss Natasha after that, but I couldn't know because there were so many things. It's a strange relationship, but they still live in harmony. I am very happy to know that you are there. "


Saying "smearing", Forli grabbed another bite of pie and said that it still tasted nostalgic.




[--- My chest hurts]


After seeing off the duke's carriage with Joseph and Natasha, he hit Sergei, who said he had ridiculed that he had eaten all the thank-you pies, hit him back, hit him again, and after a while, he rolled to the ground. It was.

At that time, Sergei said.


[I'm eating too much. Heartburn. Is the whole hall stupid alone?]

[I wanted to try it once]

[Idiot]

[Yup]


Sergei sighed.


[... I should have let you go]

[I don't want that. ...... So it's okay, this much]

[shut up. Why is it always perfect for me, idiot]


Certainly, it would never have been a love affair.

However, Sergei is already engaged to Princess Alexander, and even if she looks good, she is no longer ominous with the proud and ruthless Alexander and the unwavering, fair and gentle Sergei who is elusive even though she is serious. They were the opposite of each other.

Natasha wasn't the type to be praised as a beautiful woman, but she had petite, gentle eyes and a sweet smell. Sergei would have been happy if he had been married to Natasha.


[Never eat apple pie again]


Sergei moaned and Forli laughed.
