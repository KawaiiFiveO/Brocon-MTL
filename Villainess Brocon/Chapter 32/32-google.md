It's the rose season soon

The next day, Ekaterina rode a carriage with Alexei and returned home to the Duke's residence.



Roses have already begun to bloom in the vast gardens of the Duke's residence, and many gardeners are busy grooming them just to see them. From now on, it is said that the flowering time will be adjusted for each variety so that the day will be the best time to see it.

It is said that there are no varieties that are not in Yurunova's garden, and there are many varieties that are only in Yurunova's garden, so it must be very difficult to make them in full bloom one day. It's a big event, albeit every year.



At lunch yesterday, I was wondering what to do with costume preparation. When I returned to the dorm and talked to the maid Mina in a half-complaint, Mina nodded expressionlessly as usual.


"That's the job of the servant, so I'll arrange it. Just think about what you want to wear for Ojou-sama."


Eh, is that so? Feeling like that.

However, when I calm down and recall, I was asked to make a lot of beautiful dresses while living in the Duchy's main residence for half a year after I was out of imprisonment, but I didn't do anything myself. I just wore a new dress that was being made before I knew it.

And as far as I can remember ... I don't think it suits me very well. Where and when is the challenger wearing a bright yellow dress with plenty of frills for me, who has indigo hair and looks like an adult?


The original flow is that when I need a dress, servants such as maids and butlers call in and out designers, tell the designer what kind of dress they want, and look at the design drawings. It seems that if you like it, you will place an order.


After serving dinner, Mina went out for a while and attached an appointment to a popular designer in the imperial capital. He says he will come to the Duke's residence tomorrow.

Isn't it great to get an appointment for the next day the night before? My beautiful maid is too talented.

Well, it might be the majesty of the Duke of Yurunova.




That's why I had a meeting with the designer immediately. The designer was Camilla Croce, an up-and-coming, slender woman with intricately tied greenish-silver hair in her thirties.

I was so surprised when I advised him to sit in a chair, so should the Duke's daughter have a designer stand up for a meeting? I was worried, but I'm uncomfortable. I recommend it again and face each other across the table.


Camila was relieved when she told her that it was a costume to welcome the arrival of the imperial family and that she wanted the design to be simple enough not to be rude.


"If it's the beauty of Ojou-sama, the simpler one is more attractive. The current fashion is a design that makes the most of the beauty of the fabric, so it's perfect for your wishes. It's wonderful that it looks good on Ojou-sama. I have a sample of the fabric. It is the highest quality silk fabric ordered from the end of the east. I'm sure you like it. "

"That's it. Actually, I have a fabric I want to use."


At the signal, Mina quickly spread a few pieces of cloth on the table. It was handed over by Hallil this morning.


"Do you know the blue of the heavens?"


All cloths are bluish. The darkest color is ultramarine or lapis lazuli. It has an irresistibly beautiful color that is deep but transparent, just like the most beautiful moment of the darkness of the evening.

I fell in love at first sight! The light blue is also like the spring sky and the zenith where the highest universe in the summer sky is transparent, each of which is a beautiful blue!


Heavenly blue is the blue that is created by crushing lapis lazuli from the Duchy of Yurunova into dyes and pigments. So, by nature, this cloth is extremely expensive. On the day you make the most expensive and darkest dress, the cost probably exceeds the average annual income of the common people mercilessly.


A child who was a friend of mine in college and had a hobby of drawing illustrations was so obsessed with blue that he was emphasized many times, so even in the world of the past, lapis lazuli was used as a dye for dyeing cloth and as a pigment for paints. I knew it was. The blue name means ultramarine in English, crossing the sea. Lapis lazuli is produced in Afghanistan, so in Europe it was blue coming from across the Mediterranean Sea.

In this world, this blue has a name that literally means heavenly blue. I don't know who named it, but it's beautiful, so it's a good job.


"I know the blue of the heavens ..."


Camilla's eyes are nailed to the fabric.


"I've never seen such a beautiful color development. Is it something special?"

"Yes, it was dyed not only with lapis lazuli, but also with a different dye found in our territory."


The discoverer was Uncle Isaac, the younger brother of Sergei's grandfather. Aaron, a mineral enthusiast, seems to be the best minerallogist in the history of the empire to talk with sparkling eyes like a maiden in love.

It seems that this dye can be produced rather than mined, and it may have just been discovered that something like synthetic ultramarine used in the premortal world was used.


"This new dye is much cheaper than ever, and more beautiful than ever, and can dye the heavenly blue. Please see it with Her Majesty the Empress and evaluate it as a new product of the empire. I want to

"Cheap?"


Crispy and Camilla ate.


"Wow, oh no, with the help of the Duke of Yurunova, you don't have to worry about the price, but more ladies will be able to wear this beautiful blue. Isn't it? "

"I hope so."


The shit that hated it and disturbed it disappeared.

Actually, it seems that Uncle Isaac discovered this about ten years ago. After that, I was proceeding with research and development so that stable production could be achieved, but after my grandfather died, that damn hag said that such research would not be allowed. It is ridiculous to make the heavenly blue, which only a few noble humans should wear, cheaper and use it with those who are inferior.

So, it seems that Hallil and his colleagues secretly continued their research while nodding high and high, and completed it. However, even if Babaa disappeared, it was difficult to sell it because it was not fashionable.


…… One of the reasons is that Onii-sama and his subordinates are so busy that they can do it without the harm of that damn hag.

The heavenly blue will be destroyed at a reasonable price so that the common people can enjoy it, so it's good to grind your teeth in the shade of the grass that damn hag!


"And I also want to incorporate the gems produced in the Duchy into the design. You can choose the one you like from here."


Mina takes out a case containing various jewels and shows it to Camilla. This was received from Aaron.

All the colorful and shimmering gems are a few centimeters in diameter. The colors are also bright. I'm not familiar with the quality of jewels, but I feel like they are all ridiculously expensive in the past. Millions of yen or tens of millions of yen, 100 million yen if you're not good at it ... I'm scared to think.

Because it's just a free advertising tower! I don't get it, I lend it!


"I know it doesn't suit the current fashion, but since I'm welcoming Their Majesties on behalf of the Yurunova territory, I wanted to show the characteristics of my territory. A brooch with a simple stand. I would like to ask for a design that incorporates it. "

"Well, all the finest and finest ... this beautiful heavenly blue and jewel. The design is simple and elegant, and the protagonist is color. Yes, Ojou-sama is mysterious like a goddess. You can create beautiful beauty. Instead of following the current fashion, creative dresses ... What a wonderful thing. I will do my best! "


With that said, Camilla quickly begins to run the pen into the sketchbook.


I got really hot from here.

Camilla who wants to be simple but gorgeous vs. I want to be extremely simple to make the fabric stand out.

I thought I'd leave the design to you, but it's so much fun to worry about dresses ...! Besides, I think it might be useful for Onii-sama and all of my subordinates.


Thanks to that, I might be looking forward to the cherry blossom viewing day when I will show off my dress.

It's just a little bit, though.
