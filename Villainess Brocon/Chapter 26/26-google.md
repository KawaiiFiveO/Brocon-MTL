Event clearing and positional relationship problems

"It was good"


Hiee ⁉︎


The sudden voice makes my heart pop out of my mouth. Before I knew it, Mikhail was standing next to me.


Oh, I'm sorry Prince! I completely forgot about my existence!

You must never be aware of the facts!


The next moment I thought, Mikhail's eyes glistened.

It wasn't angry, it seemed funny, but ... I wonder why, I feel like I've forgotten it ...


"If everyone knows that Yurunova has officially been backed by Miss Czerny, her school life will be safe. It's safe to stay with her all the time and keep an eye out."


Prince ... Did you know that Flora was mean? Even though he's a royal prince, he's a really smart child. By the way, when I talked to him before, I thought it was awkward.


When I thought about it, I suddenly noticed it. The prince's uniform is dirty with dust.


Ah ... it's the clay wall just before! I tried to protect Onii-sama and the prince from the demon beast, but I lost control and collapsed ...


"Sorry, Your Highness"


In a hurry, Ekaterina flutters Mikhail's uniform.


When I think about it calmly, I didn't need that clay wall at all ...

Both Onii-sama and the prince were able to handle it better on their own.

On the contrary, it becomes a jumping platform for the demon beast, and because they lose control and collapse on top of them, they lose their magical power ...

I just pinched myself. It's no good at all ...


"His Highness, I'm really sorry to have you rush to me even though I'm a noble man.


Mumble quietly. Mikhail smiled.


"I got some delicious food the other day. My daughter's home cooking is precious."


...... The power of feeding is amazing.

No, probably because of the rules of the game. He came because the game decided that the prince would come to help the heroine.


"Then, both I and Alexei have been trained in magical combat. I've also had experience in wiping out demons. If you've never been trained in that kind of training, you can't help running out of power there. Of course. "


UU……. I'm not sure if I'm following or blaming ...

Wait a minute. I'm still 15 years old and I'm the one who has the highest succession to the throne after experiencing the demon beast sweeping!


"Well, Alexei aside, my demon beast extermination was just a ritual, and all the set-ups were completed. I'm sorry to say that. Yurunova territory has many powerful monsters, so how many times Alexei I'm sure he's commanded a serious mopping up. "


Laughing Mikhail reveals the seed.

I see, you said that the ritual was that the soldiers surrounded the demon beast that had been staring in advance and defeated it? It's scary to face that. Even though I had only such an experience, did I calm down such a huge demon beast and squeeze it down with a water gun? On the contrary, it's amazing.

And the Duke's business scope is too wide! President of a general trading company, prefectural governor, and commander of demon beast sweeping! Onii-sama, great!


"But you should be prepared. It's about Alexei, so I think it's a sermon if you settle down later. It's really hard to be preached because Alexei comes with a good reason. We're playmates from a young age. However, it's better to be preached by Alexei than to get angry with adults, so when I did something wrong, my mother called Alexei. Good luck. "


Uh ... No, what about the adults around it! However, Onii-sama …….

Oh, I don't preach because it's Onii-samasiscon!

It looks like something fun, Prince ... Is your personality pretty bad? Because this is villainess?


"So I'll tell you before that."


Mikhail smiles.

Wow!

Even if a first year high school student says something, arasa doesn't matter!


"You were very brave"


……Yes?


"I was so scared to cry, but I did my best.

I think the four people here, including the faculty and staff, have the strongest magical power in this magic school. Now that you've stepped on, these four people can come together and join forces, and no one has been killed.

It's reckless to stand alone, but I think what you did was very good. "


………………………….


Well, that's right.

It's not such a compliment.

I had knowledge of the game and knew that it would be difficult if I didn't defeat it, so I just did my best.

But hey, yeah ... I'm happy.


Maybe it's because I remembered the work of my previous life. When you are told that you will not recover from the system failure within three hours.

Almost alone, I identified the cause in 15 minutes and recovered from it in 30 minutes.

Then, when I reported the recovery, I was told, "By the time the client starts business, I will report the cause and recurrence prevention measures together."

Cause? Even though I said that I couldn't do it, it was because of the specification change that I was forced to do.

I made a report without saying that. Completely. SE is such a job.


I was praised if I did my best this time.

It's just that, but how about yourself getting sick?

I used to get used to not being rewarded in my previous life, but it was still painful.


Thank you, Prince.

It's a scary child to cry arasa at the age of fifteen. In the future, I'm sure it will be a great top, loved and feared by many subordinates.


When I thought, Mikhail took Ekaterina's hands with both hands.


"I wonder if I made you sad. I'm sorry."

"No, that's not the case."

"I wish I had. Hey, if possible, could you call me Mikhail instead of Your Highness?"

"Yes ... ha ⁉︎"


It was because I remembered Mikhail's words that I made a crazy voice that was not like a daughter. In the otome game of the previous life.

The prince, whose intimacy has increased by repelling the demon beast together, tells the heroine. Call me Mikhail.

To the heroine! Dialogue to say. Important here!

If you say to villainess


"Oh, I'm afraid."

"Alexei didn't call me His Royal Highness until he took over the title. As soon as he took over the Duke, he said the order of his vassals.

You are a relative and not a duke. No problem "


No problem! I can't say what the problem is!

What should I do with this? destruction flag What is the correct answer to avoid it?


"His Highness"


It got cooler. Not the temperature, but the back.


Of course, Alexei was the one who called out.

Tall looks bigger than usual. The reason is unknown, but for some reason it looks towering.

Therefore, the line of sight is below freezing.


"Oh, sorry"


In a hurry, Mikhail let go of Ekaterina.

Eh, is it because of this?

As expected, Onii-sama gives priority to his sister over the order of his vassals. siscon Unwavering.


Alexei walked up to Ekaterina and took his sister's hand and looked down at Mikhail.


"His Highness. Please refrain from any behavior that could damage my sister's reputation."

"I'm sorry. I was so impressed with her courage. Your sister is very brave and lovely."


Does it lose its reputation just by taking a hand? But it seems that it was certainly the case with the British Victorian aristocratic society. Be careful.


But the prince ... I think he's coming to praise me to take advantage of Onii-sama's siscon.

Don't be wise and wise at that age. Your sister is really looking forward to your future.


"Miss Czerny, please call me by name. The magical power to defeat that demon beast was wonderful. I hope you will be friends."


Oh!

Prince, great. I'm getting closer to the heroine.

Okay, that's it!


"I'm honored. Flora-sama. I'd be happy if you could call us your name without mentioning us as a lady. Flora-sama, I wonder if it's okay."

"Yes, if Ekaterina-sama says so."


Flora, who was walking up next to Ekaterina on the other side of him with Alexei, smiled after her eyes were rounded.

Then, take Ekaterina's arm and entangle her arm.


Oh cute. The power of a smile at a close distance ...

And he came to cross his arms from the other side.

Instead of Yurunova, the call of Ekaterina has taken root, and it feels like the distance has shortened at once.


Isn't this situation really good? Onii-sama in one hand, heroine in one hand. Gorgeous in both hands.

And in front of me is the prince.


...... I feel that the positional relationship is a little strange.

Flora-chan, isn't it okay to be a little more prince-friendly? I feel that the line of sight to the prince is strict.


Is it okay because it is NG to go to Guigui from here to capture the prince?

The prince looks like this, he's a hunter who chases after the opponent pulls, and he's a carnivorous type who burns when there is an obstacle or obstacle.

I'm wondering if the Onii-sama route was born, but Flora-chan, do your best!
