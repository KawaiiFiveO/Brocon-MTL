It's about time for the roses

According to Alexei's hasty explanation after seeing his sister's complexion, each of the three great dukes has a vast garden of flowers that symbolizes the house in each imperial residence, and the flowers are in full bloom. It is said that it is an annual event that the imperial family visits when the time comes.

Certainly, the Duke of Yurunova's residence has a vast rose garden. …… But it's true that the imperial family comes to see it every year.


"... I'm sorry, it's my fault."


With one hand on his forehead, Alexei is unusually upset.


"I should have told you earlier. Women should consider taking time to dress, but I'm sorry for that."

"No, no, Onii-sama. I shouldn't have known such an important thing."


It's kind of common sense for Onii-sama, and you probably don't realize that you need to explain it.

It's been eight months since I was released from imprisonment, but I think the reason I didn't know about such an important event was because I was locked up in the shell for half a year.

So Onii-sama is not bad. Yeah, Onii-sama isn't bad anyway.


However!

The emperor's family comes to see the cherry blossoms every year, and the three great dukes are amazing!

I never dreamed that it would happen!

At this moment, I'm likely to inadvertently become white-eyed!


Did you tell me if you need any preparation?

Ready?

What should I do, what should I do? Wow, I can't imagine it at all!


"Ojou-sama, I'm not so nervous. It's every year, so everyone knows.

I wonder if I should prepare my own costume. "


So Novak called out and Ekaterina returned to me.

Yeah, that's exactly right. An annual event other than me!


"Oh, I'm relieved to say that, but I'm sure it's okay, because the Duke is with me and Mikhail is there."


Stroking Ekaterina's back to encourage her, Flora says.

Ah ... right? surely.

Rest assured if you hide behind Onii-sama. One of the imperial families is a prince.

…… But the rest is the emperor and empress …… Nuo.


"Don't worry about the costumes. If they aren't too elaborate, you can hurry up and get ready. Fortunately, tomorrow weekend, I'll be back at the Duke's residence to get ready."


Halil says with a smile. Who are you who knows how long it takes to prepare a dress even though you are a man? Oh, a merchant?


I was so shocked that everyone encouraged me so much ... I have to recover quickly!


"Thank you, everyone. Thanks to you, I have calmed down."


But the costume. dress…….

I wonder if there is a fashion.


"If possible, I would like Ojou-sama to wear costumes that are different from the current fashion of women."


Ekaterina was surprised because it was Aaron who sighed. It was surprising that a young mine chief, who looked like a scholar, had an opinion on the fashion of dresses.


"Yurunova territory also produces gems, but in recent years the price has dropped because women don't want very luxurious gems. For several years now, the fashion has been imported from the other side of [The Summit of the Gods] It is said that it is a gorgeous silk fabric. Since the main character of the costume is a cloth woven with a beautiful pattern, it seems that big jewels are getting in the way or have a bad taste. "


The summit of the gods is a large mountain range that rises in the center of the continent and divides the east and west. It resembles the Himalayas of the previous life, but is steeper and seems to penetrate the continent like a spine. Therefore, east-west trade is almost limited to sea routes.


"I've come to be able to sell even if I mine the finest products ...

Even though jewels are mineral flowers. I'm sorry. "


Aaron is sad.


…… Aaron, were you a mineral enthusiast? The enthusiasts are so excited that they even become the mine manager.

But [even if you mine the finest]?


"Well, until now, even if you could mine good gems, you couldn't sell them?"


When I asked a simple question, a subtle air flowed into the office.

Why?


When I thought about it, Alexei told me bitterly.


"My grandmother forbade me to sell them to others, saying they belonged to me .... It's better than being told to the iron mine, so I liked it that much."


…… Ah, that damn hag!

Did you do that in addition to the bride-in-law?


And Onii-sama, I noticed it lightly, but after all, I was in charge of the work of the Duchy from the time of my father and that damn hag.

I should have kept my child working, and even imitated myself to interfere with the work, and I should have been seriously eaten by the demon beast and became shit that damn hag!


...... Let's calm down. That damn hag is no longer a person in this world. If humans die, they are all Buddhas.

There is no Buddhism in this world.

But let's calm down. How about yourself.


So, do you want me to showcase the goodness of jewelry?

It looks like a tourist ambassador to promote special products, but ... Will the tourist ambassador be in charge of villainess?


"Large jewels are not suitable for young women, but if they have a dignified beauty like Ojou-sama, they will look good. Her Majesty the Empress also prepares a gem that envy. We will do it, so please use it.

That's right, His Excellency, [Heavenly Blue], isn't it perfect for Ojou-sama? Ojou-sama, by all means. Her Majesty the Empress is about to launch the next epidemic. It's a good opportunity to see


Mr. Halil, you're a man who uses me as a free advertising tower. What is heavenly blue, I hope it helps. But I can't expect any effect ...


"Ekaterina, if you don't like the jewels and the blue of the heavens, you don't have to use them. You can do whatever you want. If you like the imported silk fabrics, buy as much as you like. If you want to entertain Her Majesty, that's safer. But because it is.

It was Her Majesty the Empress who created the fashion for imported silk fabrics. Yurusein, my parents' house, has an important port for east-west trade, so it will be enriched if imports flourish. But not only that, the amount of empire's products exported to the east has also increased, benefiting the empire as a whole. He is wise. "

"Oh dear……"


Ekaterina admired Alexei's words.


"You are attracting eastern merchants by popularizing silk fabrics with high profit margins.

The fabric alone will leave a vacancy in the hold of the cargo ship, so it should bring in other products that could be sold in the empire. If other commodities are distributed in the empire at a slightly lower price, in combination with high-margin silk fabrics, it will be a lot of buying and selling. And when they return to the east, they will buy goods that will sell in the eastern countries and fill the hold, so exports of Imperial products will increase. Shall we do that? "


Hmmm, do it, Her Majesty the Empress.

Even in the previous life, it was ideal to have both the princess of the Warring States period and the Italian women of the Renaissance period, bridging the parents' house and the married house.


"What a wonderful thing to do. From the empress's position of leading the fashion of costumes, the economy is naturally activated from the natural point of view, and the empire also complements the parents' home without being pointed by anyone. It's exciting.

He is like an empress, like a book. "

"... Ekaterina-sama understands it instantly."


Novak growls. Is there any other 15-year-old girl who can understand this instantly?

No, it's because the content is arasa, a former woman, and SE who has also developed commercial systems such as distribution system and ordering system, and also because she likes economic document programs and often watches it. ..


"Ojou-sama, would you like to be the Empress one day and do that yourself?"

"Oh! I don't really think I hate it."


Ekaterina instantly killed Novak's words in a spinal reflex. It is a straight-ahead Karatake split.


Because! Even the demon beast event that I thought was so unlikely happened according to the scenario of the game!

If villainess wants to be the empress and aims at the prince, I'm sure the destruction flag will stand immediately! Absolutely! I'm scared!


I'm sorry, Novak turned white when I noticed ...


"Oh, I'm sorry. I'm selfish, but I don't like the imperial family ..."

"... Goodbye"

"Okay, that's what I forgave."


Novak sighed, but Alexei was in a good mood.


"Rozen, my sister will be intelligent. Until I marry my wife or this child marries another family, this Ekaterina is the hostess of Yurunova. ..

Dedicate a sword and pledge of allegiance the day before the imperial family arrives. If anything to me, the Knights will make him Ekaterina and obey his orders. "

"I have been appointed, Your Excellency"


The knight captain stood up and put his fist on his chest to bow.


"My sister's gentle and intelligent temperament has been heard from Mardu, who is joining the Knights. I am honored to be a lady of the Knights."


Lady of the Knights? Dedicate a sword? What is that medieval chivalric romance and girly fantasy romantic words. arasa also flutters involuntarily.


Alexei stroked her eye-popping sister's hair and smiled.


"You haven't got much of what you should get as a daughter of Yurunova yet. Let's get it right first. You're weak and you don't have to aim for the empress's position. Now both Just think about preparing for your Majesty's worship. "

"Yes, Onii-sama. I'll do what you say."


Relieved Ekaterina nodded.


Thank you Onii-sama.

And I'm sorry to think that you should delete the sickness setting. It's a good reason why you can't become an empress because you're sick!

From now on, as a measure against the destruction flag, we will utilize the disease setting!
