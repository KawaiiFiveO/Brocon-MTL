Fighting together

With a scream, the students ran away from the training ground.


That's right! Run away quickly!

It's so scary, even when I came across a golden retriever wandering around with no lead in my previous life, I was a little scared, but I was glaring at the grizzly-sized apt carnivorous beast. It's 100 million times scarier than the Golden Retriever, it's an incarnation of horror!


One of the girls running away fell tangled in her leg. Crawling in a panic.

Besides, the demon beast leaned forward. As if laughing with a grin, he opens his mouth with three rows of sharp fangs lined up.


At the tip of that nose, go! The clay wall swelled with a noise, separating the demon beast and the schoolgirl.


Guru ... and moaning, the demon beast smashes the earthen wall with a single swing of his head. The girl student who collapsed during that time stood up and escaped from the training ground.


The demon beast turns his head and glares at us. The dull anger that can be seen in the black eyes.

You know ... Who owns the magical power that made the clay wall?


Yeah, I haven't run away. If everyone runs away, this guy will chase after the schoolyard and school building.


To be honest, I'm really scared! The trembling of my legs is going to be great, I'm too scared and teary eyes!

It's too different from what you see on your smartphone screen, there's nothing in the same world, and a giant carnivore blows murder. I have never experienced a predator facing a predator without a cage or a moat in my previous life! ︎


But I knew it! I was preparing!

My classmates are almost 15 years old. I'm just a kid. This is arasa. Because it's an adult.

What do you do to protect it!

So don't run away! ︎




Mr. Mardu, a tutor, gave me this advice in a letter.


[Ojou-sama, what to do if you encounter the monster you asked for, but in the case of the earth attribute, it is recommended that you first generate the largest golem possible to intimidate the monster. Depending on the nature of the demon beast, it will escape without going against creatures larger than you, so try it]


I don't think he'll run away ...

But I'll do it!


Shed magical power on the ground. The soil will respond. Like water springing from the bottom of a spring, the soil rises up and down and takes the shape of a person's upper body. Its size is about the size of a three-story house.

Shape your fist and swing it up.


From the other side of the golem, I heard a roaring roar.


The jumping demon beast smashes the golem's fist, descends above the golem's head, and roars again.

His eyes looked at Ekaterina as if shooting through.


I glared back.

I have teary eyes!


Break the golem at once. A lump of soil falls on the fallen demon beast.

However, soon the demon beast flicked off the clod with a single sword and took a step forward with its thick front legs.


coming?

Ah, it ’s close, I ’m scared!

But I'll meet you!


The demon beast kicked the ground,

At that time.


The magical power was tense.


A glittering shield appears in front of the demon beast. A dark gray giant, about three meters long and weighing perhaps three to four hundred kilograms, was repelled by its shield and rolled to the ground.


The shield also falls to the ground, and cold air blows in. This shield is ice.

A tall light blue hair appeared at the entrance of the training ground.


"Ekaterina!"


Onii-sama!

Wow, you came!




Seeing it as a new enemy, the demon beast turns to Alexei.


With a strong light in his neon blue eyes, Alexei looked at the demon beast. There is no fear there. And the overwhelming magical power that springs up inside him.


Alexei shook his right hand.


Don't!


An ice spear appears through the body of the demon beast.

It was not created by throwing ice through it, but by creating frost in the body of the demon beast with magical power. Perfectly managed the difficult magical power control and tore the demon beast from the body.


great!

Onii-sama is strong! It's cool!


As expected, the demon beast also staggered.

However, when he roars again and shakes himself, the ice spear breaks. Blue-black blood blew out, but it stopped.



I remember Dr. Mardu's advice.


[Unlike other creatures, demon beasts do not die unless they destroy the demon core in their bodies. The demon nucleus is usually found in the heart, but it is not uncommon for individuals to not. In some cases, there was a demon core on the tip of the foot or tail, and if the demon core cannot be destroyed by attacking the heart, the destruction should be given up and the movement should be blocked in some way.

In the first place, it is difficult to destroy the magic nucleus with the magical power of the earth attribute, so it is recommended to confine it in the ground to block the movement]


Alexei's attack could have destroyed the heart, but the demon core was probably not there.

If so, a hand that traps it in the ground and blocks its movement. But can such an agile guy be trapped? I have no choice but to do it!



When. The water of the fountain in the training ground spouted high.


A large amount of water falls from above the demon beast.

It was frozen by the magical power of Alexei.


Water --- Yes, speaking of the owner of the magical power of water attributes.


If you look at the entrance of the training ground, you will see the summer sky blue hair next to Alexei. Prince Mikhail stands with a scary expression that he sees for the first time, with a magical power that is as good as Alexei.


Noble & royal super handsome men fight side by side! Geki Moe!

There must even be a three-meter-long demon beast struggling in front of them to break the ice that covered their heads!

No matter how nice they are, I'm scared and can't cut my eyes from the demon beast! The sound of the earth is amazing!


But Mikhail doesn't just supply water, but every time the demon smashes the ice that binds it, it slams the water like a spear to stagger the monster's giant, shutting off the attack and closing it back in the ice. I'm trying. It's a wonderful magic control.

Both Alexei and Mikhail probably know how to deal with the demon beast. There seems to be even experience of fighting.


Both of them have the highest status in the empire, but why do they seem to have high experience points? Really amazing!


If you notice, the ground around the demon beast is completely muddy.

Then ...


Mud mixed with elements other than soil is difficult to handle, but it squeezes magical power. The mud crawls up the demon's body, and the freezing air freezes it. The hardness of permafrost is said to be comparable to that of concrete, and the effect of blocking movement should be higher than that of ice.

In addition, sledding and avoiding the soil from the feet of the rampaging demon beast. The demon beast sinks as if it had fallen into a pit. The soil that was avoided is layered on top of the frozen soil sooner than the demon beast shakes it off, turning it into a restraint that does not even allow struggle.


Before I knew it, I was breathing on my shoulder. Wow!

But I can do it. I'm sure it will be soon.


One day, the demon beast was completely covered with permafrost.

It doesn't work anymore. I can't move.


I won.

Wonder?


that moment.


Bishi! The sound of cracks echoed.


Guoooooooo!


An angry roar roars, and the crushed permafrost peels off from the demon beast that stood up on its hind legs.

A dark gray giant jumped at Alexei and Mikhail.


Stop it! ︎


Immediately releasing magical power, a clay wall rises in front of them.



But, as if I was reading it, the demon beast landed on the earthen wall,


Kick it and jump to a much higher height,


From that height, I peeled off my fangs and aimed at it.



It falls toward Ekaterina.


(e……)


My head turned white.



[Flying type monsters cannot be captured by the magical power of the earth attribute. Run away or hide]


It's not a flight, but ...

Teacher, neither is possible ...


A panic causes him to lose control of his magical power, and the earthen wall he built in front of Alexei and the prince collapses.



fool.


Even though it's villainess

Even though it's not a heroine

I couldn't beat it.


As a game

Like not to die.

Misunderstand.


Onii-sama I'm sorry!



As my thoughts pass through my mind, I can't take my eyes off the three rows of white fangs as if I was fascinated.



Suddenly, the cherry blossoms spread in front of me.


"No good!"


A tense voice strikes my ears.

White light was emitted from the cherry blossoms.



Flora covers Ekaterina, spreads her arms, and stands between her and the demon beast.

The demon beast was struggling in the air. Wrapped in a soft white light, it is painful. No matter how violent the giant is, the white light does not fluctuate.


The movement of the demon beast, which did not move even if it pierced the body, became weak. It seems that my anger has disappeared from my black eyes and I have a clear light.


The demon beast that had stopped moving quietly stared at Flora with his eyes.


The white light disappeared, and the demon beast also disappeared.
