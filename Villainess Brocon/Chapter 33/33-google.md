Insects easily attach to roses

"... Ojou-sama is a person who thinks differently from his grandmother."


When the design of the dress was almost decided, Camila was told that she was familiar with it, and Ekaterina thought it was awkward.


"Have you ever met your grandmother?"

"Yes, when I was just starting out. A tough person ... No, he was a dignified and proud person."


Say that damn hag.

I can't say it, but I want to say it.


"With my grandmother ... I wonder if something happened."

"No! ... No, he was famous for ordering dresses frequently, so I tried to make a dress by trying to catch my eye. I paid it, but I did. I didn't like it. It was a gorgeous dress with a complicated design ... "


As a member of society.

Really, Ekaterina clears her throat.


"Yes, then ... have you paid?"

"Yeah, you understand well. Yes, I couldn't pay for it."


Ku, So, Ba, Ba, A ~~~~ ︎

If you're proud, don't step down from a fledgling designer! ︎


"I'm sorry, but do you have something that can prove that you haven't paid?"

"Yes, then I have received a letter. I am from my grandmother's attendant, but I do not accept it because I do not like it, so I have to pay."


...... I'm getting a headache.

Why don't you pay for it because you don't like it while receiving the actual item? Is it springing up?


"Mina ……"

"I will tell the butler."

"Thank you. Please show the letter to the butler and receive the payment. I apologize for my grandmother's behavior."

"Thank you……!"


Camilla bows deeply.

I wonder if dress designers have a hard time raising funds. I'm really sorry that damn hag.


"What a wonderful person Ojou-sama is. He is kind, has a good taste, and is young but well-informed .... He is a princess of the Duke of Yurunova, but he is like me. I was deeply moved by the kindness of the people. "


Oh no.

It's just not a princess. I'm really sorry.

Well, he's flattering me, but I'm disappointed because it's a scam.


"If you like this dress, please continue to patronize us."

"Yes, this is it. If you feel the potential of designing with heavenly blue, I would be grateful if you could recommend it to the ladies of the imperial capital. It is not well known yet. of"

"Yeah! I definitely want to use it. I have an idea for those who are sensitive to new things that look good on me. It's a wonderful color, and I will sell it for Ojou-sama."

"I'm happy to say that."


Maybe it will be a plus for Camilla herself. Is it possible to make new proposals to customers?

Best regards with Win-Win!




Ekaterina headed to a room in the Duke's residence after Camilla returned, promising that she would take the measurements on the spot and bring her tentative dress next week.

It is a room with portraits of the head of the Duke of Yurunova and his family. From the first Sergei to the current Alexei, various figures fill the wide wall.


Ekaterina looks up at the two shots of her dandy grandfather Sergei, who sits comfortably in a chair, and Alexei, a ten-year-old boy with no monocle, who stands beside him with a serious expression, and prepares his mind lightly. I turned my eyes next to it.


...... It's uselessly big!


A young woman is depicted in a particularly large portrait. very beautiful. Slender and tall, the costumes she wears are luxurious. The long, light blue hair tied up sparkles a gorgeous tiara, and the necklace and earrings are adorned with huge jewels. I should be smiling, but somehow the frosty eyes are light blue. It's annoying to be similar to Onii-sama.

This is my grandmother. When I was young. Princess Alexander.

Why did you mix the portraits of the Duke of Yurunova with the portraits of the princess days! I wonder if I wasn't a family yet!


(That damn hag)


Mutter without making a voice. Don't let Mina hear behind you.


Hmm! I turned away and looked next to it.

He hangs on a chair in a relaxed manner, crosses his long legs, and depicts a transcendental beauty with a sweet smile. This is just like Onii-sama without light blue hair, light blue eyes, and monocles. Father, Alexander.


Next to it is Onii-sama. A beautiful young man who stands dignifiedly with a sword in his hand. The beautiful face that resembles his father is tightly tightened because he realizes that he must stand alone with the Duke of Yurunova, who has tremendous power and enormous wealth, and is trying to confront it. ..


Unlike me, who looks like my mother, Onii-sama has a grandmother and father's lineage. However, the color of their eyes is just light blue, and it does not seem to be that impressive neon blue of Onii-sama, which seems to emit light by itself. It's a portrait, so maybe I just couldn't draw that much.

However, the portrait of Onii-sama, both the two-shot with his grandfather and the one by Onii-sama alone, expresses the color of Onii-sama's eyes well. It may be a difference in the skill of the painter. However, I want to think that it was a really different shade.


"Ojou-sama"


Called by a non-Mina voice, Ekaterina turned around.

An elderly woman in a dark dress. The dress is a dress of a housekeeper who bundles female servants. However, she is not a housekeeper.


"I've been told by a butler. Do you need it?"

"Yes. I wonder if you were a maid of your grandmother."

"My name is Nonna Zares."

"Yes. My grandmother used to order dresses often. You haven't disposed of them yet, I'd like to see what they look like. Please show me to the storage location."


Nonna then bowed slightly, turned her back on Ekaterina, and started walking without footsteps.

This attitude ... well, I was expecting it.


Ekaterina asks Nonna as she walks afterwards.


"What kind of person was your grandmother from your point of view?"

"I was the best lady"


The answer is returned once and for all. It's like a model answer that you know.


"Then, what kind of person is your father?"


This time, there was a short time before the answer.


"... It was a wonderful person. He was a fascinating lord who captivated every woman. He was not only beautiful but also a sophisticated gentleman who always treated women kindly. It was boring. He was a person who was always laid back and enjoyed life regardless of the world. "


-In short, it's crap!

What's more, he's a captive of every woman ... he's a ton demo-level tarashi guy. Is it Mr. Hikaru Genji? The face is similar to Onii-sama, but if you put the specs of Onii-sama into putting a woman in, it will be like this, isn't it the final form?

Well, I'm a fucking father who is still letting his child Onii-sama do the clerical work behind the scenes and licking it.


"That's right. What kind of thing is a boring world, for example?"


Nonna turned around and stared at Ekaterina.


"It's a document, a money account, it's such a dry thing."

"Well, my dad didn't count the money."


Ekaterina looks back at Nonna with a really funny smile.

Nonna's gaze became strict, but Ekaterina's smile didn't hurt.


Looking away, Nonna starts walking again.

Huh, I won.

I'm sorry.


However, upon arriving at his destination, Ekaterina was about to collapse from his knees.

What the hell!

It wasn't a walk-in closet. Walk-in hall! It's natural to walk in the hall, but the hall is filled with dresses so that a small party can be held! The entire hall is a closet! The hall is a dress graveyard!

The horror taste that countless dresses on the torso look dim in the dark with the window shutters closed, perhaps to prevent the dress from fading!

That damn hag's obsession seems to be drifting and I'm really scared.


"This is not all. There are many more in the Duchy's main residence.

This is what the lady is going to do. "


Nonna is proud for some reason.


"My grandmother ordered a dress at least once a week. I never wear a dress through my sleeves twice, and if I don't like the finished product, I don't wear it. I didn't even allow you to see me again. This regal, this pride is the proof of the best lady. "


And Nonna chilledly looked at Ekaterina.


"Ojou-sama has been in the imperial capital for about two months, but he says he's ordering a dress for the first time. It's sad. What do you think of Yurunova's family name?

We must show the power of the Duke's family so that we cannot be underestimated by the things below. Let me introduce you to the best designers who can match your grandmother's strict glasses. From now on, make a dress at least every weekend.

You should be aware that how you treat your servants is far from being a lady, as Ojou-sama is doing now. I will only tell you what my grandmother did. Only I, who served near my grandmother, can do that.

I will make Ojou-sama a fine lady. "

"Well ... can a lady be made by ordering a lot of dresses?"

"It shows that you are a wealthy house that can do it, but it's even crap. The lady just lives in beauty. It's a sneaky trapped in the crappy world of wealth and power. It is the behavior of a lady to despise both of them and strive to polish their own beauty surrounded by beauty. "

"Oh dear"


Ekaterina laughed, cheeking, with her hand on her mouth.


"What a vulgar"
