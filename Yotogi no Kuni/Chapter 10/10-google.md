Episode 10: Eternal Friends

"In other words, to summarize your story, is it okay to have destroyed the sealed doors of other countries and signed an unequal treaty to obtain the treasure that was inside? I made you a prince? I raised it, but I didn't mean to rob it. "

"I have no words to return."

"I have no words to return, not. Idiot."



　In the innermost part of the royal palace, in the most beautiful and robust room on the continent, the lion king Schwan-Helifarte listened to his son's report and sat on the throne and put his hand on his forehead.



　It's about the age of middle age, but thatIwaoIwaoThe body like is not weakened at all,Tobi colorTobiiroHis eyes were still full of dignity that he was the king of the continent.



"In the first place, why did you go to a remote area such as Aquila? I told you to go on a leisure trip, but the countries you are choosing are all small countries away from Helifalte. From the neighboring country," The prince is still I'm rushing to say, "Why don't you come?"

"Just because I'm traveling to a country of my own personal choice, I don't necessarily have to visit."

"Do you think it's unreasonable not to go to the second largest neighbor on the continent, even though many countries have gone to the smallest country?"

"I'm going to say hello"

"Someday, I don't know why you're just going far away. I'm sure you're going to get some time, because there's" that "in the neighboring country."

"……I agree with you"

"Oops, I'm off the hook. Let's return to your folly against the Princess of Aquila. I set out on a journey because I already considered you as an adult. Nevertheless, this Such a frivolous action ... "

"Oh, that's okay. It's romantic."



　Intercepting Schwan's sermon was a loose platinum blonde woman sitting on another throne. Unlike Schwan, who makes a frown, he puts his palms together in a really fun way and makes a smile with a smile.



"It's not good ... Ibis, you're always sweet to Milan, so behave carelessly like this."

"Oh, you used to be a lot of crazy for me."

"Uh"



　Schwan flutters when he is struck by a painful place. The soft-hearted woman, called Ibis, is now a queen, but she was originally one of Helifalte's servants.



　In order to fulfill the love of different status, Schwan in his youthHardshipKannanshinkuOvercame and achieved the goal. He further developed Helifalte and created a track record of Milan called the Holy Prince. Now there is no one to stab the king and queen.



"Milan"

"What is it? Mother"

"I had a lot of trouble when I was young, but I was able to overcome it. Princess Selene is a child who has had a lot more trouble than me, so please take responsibility and make her happy."

"I know"



　When Ibis said so, Schwan, who was sitting beside him, shrugged. It's a signal of surrender.



"I can't beat my wife, even if I'm called the Lion King. It's been treated as a formal transaction between nations, and I wonder if I can go back again now."

"Can you forgive me?"

"As I said earlier, I treat you as a man. You take responsibility for the problems you have at your own discretion. That's all I can say."

"Thank you!"



　With that said, Milan is before the king and queen, who are fathers and mothers and the highest powers in the country.KneelingKneelingThere was.



"Well, is this the end of the humorous exchange? So what are you doing with Milan and her beautiful princess Selene now?"



　Suddenly erasing his heavy attitude, Schwan looks into Milan as if he were digging into the throne. His eyes were shining, and he looked like a child who wanted to see a cute kitten who came home early.



"Father, calm down. I just told you to solve my problem ..."

"I don't care about public-private confusion, but that's the end of the public talk. It's my personal interest from now on. I'd like to see it personally."

"Well, I want to see Selene-chan so cute. Hey, could you bring me a little?"



　Milan smiled at the two people's faces. Although they are kings, queens, and princes, they were a family before that.



"I'm sorry, but Selene is taking a rest now."



　I'll meet you after tomorrow, and when I tried to connect with, the back door suddenly opened with a bang. When the three Milanese turned their eyes, Marie stood alone. Maybe I'm running, I'm breathing on my shoulder.



"Marie? What's wrong, in such a hurry?"

"Selene ... Selene ...!"



　Marie, frantically, hugged her in Milan's chest.





　　◆ ◇ ◆ ◇ ◆





　Selene, who sleeps in a daze, was literally carried in her arms in Milan, hugging her princess. Just behind Milan, who walks silently in the corridor, Marie is drowning.



"Why didn't you call the maids nearby?"

"... I was impatient"



　Marie muttered while looking down. Suddenly Selene collapsed, and what came to her mind as a relief was not the maid or servant nearby, but her brother, who she could rely on.



"I should have told you that Selene is tired so let me rest."

"I thought about playing so that I wouldn't get tired properly!"



　Playing outside would be bad, but listening to music in the room would be fine. In consideration of Marie, she took out Selene. However, it was a very bad choice for Selene.



　The heavy melody played by the court musician is the best entertainment that citizens cannot listen to without paying a lot of money. However, for Selene, who didn't listen to music other than anime songs, it was only a sleep-inducing agent. Two people were sitting side by side in Marie's room, but Selene, who couldn't stand the sleep, finally collapsed from her chair.



　As expected, Selene would have woken up if she was hit on a hard floor, but the carpet, which was softer and softer than a half-baked bed, gently wrapped Selene's body. Selene, who had only slept for ten hours due to her movement and was sleep deprived, fell into a deep sleep without waking up.



　Marie, who was next to me, was astonished. The girl, who was sitting quietly, fell to the ground without any warning. Moreover, no matter how much you call or shake, there is no sign of waking up. Judging that it was not the only thing, Marie rushed to the king where her brother was, half-crying.



"As a result, this child fell down because of your selfishness. Why did you do this?"

"Because everyone doesn't care about me. My dad and mom are busy, my brother goes on a trip, and I brought such a cute girl and wondered if I wasn't there anymore. gate……"



　Marie slams words on Milan's back. He took out Selene because he wanted to play with a cute child of his generation, but more than that, he was more like a tribute to his brother and family.



"Do you remember Mia?"

"e?"



　After a short pause, Marie lost her voice to Milan's words that were suddenly thrown.

　It was a name that would never be forgotten in Marie's short life.



"I remember. It was a very cute, white kitten with the same color as Selene."

"You've been tinkering with that newborn kitten because it's cute. You'll remember what happened as a result."

"……Yup"



　Marie replied with a fading voice. Many years ago, Marie found a kitten abandoned in the corner of the castle and brought it home. Marie, who was nice to pick up but wasn't taken care of, entrusted the kitten to Milan.



　The kitten was fine despite being abandoned, but one day when Milan went to see what was going on, he was tired and sick. Marie was exhausted because of Marie, who kept herself in the absence of her brother. Fortunately, she recovered quickly after being nursed by Milan again, but Milan picked up the kitten from Marie, who hates crying, and gave it to one of her cat-loving servants. However, Marie couldn't understand why she brought up such a story.



"This child was abandoned by his mother."

"eh!?"



　Milan simply tells Marie only a part of Selene's secret. Marie was astonished at the line. The mother abandons her child. That was something she couldn't think of when she grew up in a greenhouse.



"Eh, eh? That's weird. Because a mother is a mother, isn't she abandoning me? It's impossible. If that happens, you'll be crazy."



　Maybe Marie is confused, she says without organizing her thoughts. Selene's head was pretty crazy before she was abandoned, but that's something that no one else knows.



"This kid is the same as Mia. Just as you couldn't abandon the abandoned kitten, I couldn't leave him alone. I'm not going to neglect you. I'm selfish. It's okay to say, but be kind to Selene. "



　He brought Selene into the room and laid him on the bed, and Milan lightly stroked Marie's head and left without saying anything. In the large room, only two girls were left behind, but Marie refused to leave. When I carried the chair near me to the side of the bed, I said nothing and looked into Selene's face, which kept sleeping.



　After a while, Selene woke up when the sky turned madder red. This was the time when Selene was most active, and I took a good nap, so my drowsiness was completely blown away.



"Selene! You got up!"

"Wow !?"



　The moment Selene opens her eyes, Marie hugs Selene's neck. It was a nice situation, but Selene made her eyes black and white. I had never been hugged by a blonde Lori suddenly when I woke up, so the confusion outweighs the joy of Selene.



"I suddenly collapsed, but it's okay !? It's not painful !?"

"Heiki"



　With that said, Selene was finally able to understand the current situation. I remember being invited to listen to music, but I have no memory of what happened. Maybe I've definitely fallen asleep. No matter how sleepy I was, it's too rude. He was silent about what the excuse was, but Marie seems to have taken the silence as Selene's anger.



"I'm angry ... I'm sorry."



　Marie's usual bullish attitude is like a lie, slumping and squeezing her little hand on her lap.



"Oh, that, I ... I haven't had any friends, so I don't know how to get along."

"Mr. Maribel, do you have any friends?"

"Yup"

"Hime in Hime, what?"

“…………”



　When Selene mysteriously tilted her head, Marie looked at the floor, but after a while she opened a heavy mouth.



"I'm certainly the best of the princesses, but that's it. The really great are my father and mother. The strongest is my brother, I'm nothing."

"Mr. Maribel, isn't it great?"

"My brother is amazing. He can exercise, he is smart, and he has a lot of magical power. The child who was born first gets the most magical power. So, other children play Even if you give me, I'm telling you that I can't do it behind the scenes, I know. "



　So Selene remembered the sealed door she was trapped in. My sister Arue could open it by holding her hand over the door, but there was almost no reaction when she touched it. If you believe in Marie's words, you may not have much magical power.



"So, if I weren't a princess, no one would deal with me ..."



　Perhaps because Selene doesn't say anything, Marie vomits her emotions and gradually tears. Selene gently opens her mouth to Marie.



"I didn't have any friends, either."

"e……?"



　Now, the white girl in front of me said: "I didn't have any friends."

　It's not "not there" but "not there".

　Marie notices it and opens her mouth with a fright.



"Selene, aren't you angry? Maybe you think I'm a friend ...?"

"If Maribel forgive me"



　Selene smiles at Marie, who is about to cry. The beautiful way of laughing is not a calculation like other aristocratic daughters and princesses, but a joy that is not lying, as a young Marie.



　It's true that Selene says "I don't have friends", but that's the story of the old man. Previously Selene had no friends. Or rather, there are still only mice. Even so, now I'm being asked by a beautiful blonde Lori girl to make friends, can I not be pleased with this?



"Are you really okay with me? I have nothing good?"

"is there"

"No! I'm not smart, I'm not strong, and I don't have much magical power!"

"Are, Maribel-sama is Maribel-sama."



　The words, which Selene slammed like nothing, shook Marie's heart.



"(This child is saying the same thing as his father!)"



　In the past, Marie once angered her father and mother, "Why did I have less magical power, and why did I not produce as good as my brother?" To Marie, who cries and rampages, her father and mother said:



"You don't think it makes sense to be born because you don't have the ability? That's not true. Marie, we can gain strength just by being with you as Marie. By carrying something on your back, you hone yourself to give it happiness. It's worth it. You may not know it now, but there are people who definitely need you besides us. Will appear. "



　I thought that was a lie. Until now, the little girl was sick of seeing Marie with some cold eyes, except for the family who said that. Marie knows that there is something behind her that she calls herself "the departure of the Holy Prince Milan" compared to her brother who is too good.



　That is why Marie has acted arrogantly, calling herself a "princess in a princess." If you don't insist, you'll be crushed by the stigma of incompetence. However, the ephemeral white girl in front of her says that even if she exposes her weaknesses, she still recognizes herself as a friend.



　In reality, Selene just thought, "It's worth it just because it's a beautiful blonde girl." Selene was the type of person who chose the former without hesitation when asked to support either the violent criminal Lori Bishoujo or the saint's old man.



"Thank you. Selene"

"Yeah, Maribel-sama, because she's cute."

"Marie"

"e?"

"Marie is fine, because it's weird to look like a friend, right?"



　Marie smiled. The dark shadows I had just disappeared, and my eyes were shining back.



"Selene, do you have a spell?"

"Are you magic?"

"Oh, that's right. I don't know Selene. Hey, can I get some hair?"

"it's okay, but"



　With that said, Marie hunted the shelves in Selene's room and took out something like a small thread trimmer. Marie wraps around behind Selene, who raises her half on the bed, and Marie gets into Selene's hair.Hand combTegushiThrough.



"Beautiful hair ... smooth, pure white, like silk thread. I wish I could stretch it more."

"Mendou"



　Marie laughs softly at the unadorned reply.



　One hot and humid summer day, Selene once made her a round shaven because of her habit when she was an old man. Arue, who came to see the situation, suddenly fell ill when she saw her younger sister who became bald. After that, Selene was shown to the doctor in the castle, misdiagnosed as a seizure behavior due to extreme stress, and was monitored for a while. After that, I compromised with a shortcut to the shoulder area.



"Then, I'll get a little."



　Marie cuts Selene's hair a little with scissors, then wraps it around and dexterously knits it into a ring.



"It's done! How good is it?"

"Good!"



　Selene was applauding involuntarily. Marie braided her pure white hair to create a small white ring. Selene's eyes are rounded when she is really dexterous. Then, put the ring on the little finger of your right hand, and this time, cut Marie's shining gold hair and make a ring in the same way.



"Selene, can you put out your right hand?"

"like this?"



　When Selene extended her right hand, Marie put a gold ring on Selene's right little finger.



"what's this?"

"Girls make accessories using their own hair. By exchanging them, they can become eternal friends, which is a magic that is passed down to Helifalte."

"Girl, Eien, Friend"



　Selene has an unspeakable delusion, but of course, she is a friend in a pure sense.



"It seems that there are few children who actually do it. It's the first time I've done it to Selene. See you again. Let's play when I'm fine!"



　With that said, Marie winks and leaves the room. Selene saw off the rear view of the energetic girl, as the gloomy atmosphere no longer existed.



"As far as I can see, she never seems incompetent."

"Butler, did you return?"

"It seemed like it was being taken in, so I was silent. It is true that Prince Milan is by far the best, but there are some subtleties that men do not understand, because they are women. I can't do things just because of the superiority or inferiority of power. "

"Not just from power"



　Selene imprinted the words on her chest, as if to bite Butler's lines. That's right, a simple collision of forces is not a match, but there are various搦FromYou may be able to defeat the prince with your hands. Fighting is not just about power. Selene laughed so much.



　Rather than that, it was more rewarding to get along with Marie today. The resigned hand decided to think tomorrow, and Selene stared at the little finger of her right hand forever with a laugh that didn't tighten.
